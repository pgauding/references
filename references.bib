  abstract = {Despite growing attention to the problem of obesogenic environments, there has not been a comprehensive review evaluating the food environment\textendash{}diet relationship. This study aims to evaluate this relationship in the current literature, focusing specifically on the method of exposure assessment (GIS, survey, or store audit). This study also explores 5 dimensions of ``food access'' (availability, accessibility, affordability, accommodation, acceptability) using a conceptual definition proposed by Penchansky and Thomas (1981). Articles were retrieved through a systematic keyword search in Web of Science and supplemented by the reference lists of included studies. Thirty-eight studies were reviewed and categorized by the exposure assessment method and the conceptual dimensions of access it captured. GIS-based measures were the most common measures, but were less consistently associated with diet than other measures. Few studies examined dimensions of affordability, accommodation, and acceptability. Because GIS-based measures on their own may not capture important non-geographic dimensions of access, a set of recommendations for future researchers is outlined.},

  shorttitle = {Measuring the Food Environment Using Geographical Information Systems},
  abstract = {Objective: Through a literature review, we investigated the geographic information systems (GIS) methods used to define the food environment and the types of spatial measurements they generate. Design: Review study. Setting: Searches were conducted in health science databases, including Medline/ Pubmed, PsycINFO, Francis and GeoBase. We included studies using GIS-based measures of the food environment published up to 1 June 2008.
Results: Twenty-nine papers were included. Two different spatial approaches were identified. The density approach quantifies the availability of food outlets using the buffer method, kernel density estimation or spatial clustering. The proximity approach assesses the distance to food outlets by measuring distances or travel times. GIS network analysis tools enable the modelling of travel time between referent addresses (home) and food outlets for a given transportation network and mode, and the assumption of travel routing behaviours. Numerous studies combined both approaches to compare food outlet spatial accessibility between different types of neighbourhoods or to investigate relationships between characteristics of the food environment and individual food behaviour.
Conclusions: GIS methods provide new approaches for assessing the food environment by modelling spatial accessibility to food outlets. On the basis of the available literature, it appears that only some GIS methods have been used, while other GIS methods combining availability and proximity, such as spatial interaction models, have not yet been applied to this field. Future research would also benefit from a combination of GIS methods with survey approaches to describe both spatial and social food outlet accessibility as important determinants of individual food behaviours.},

  shorttitle = {Measures of the Food Environment},
  abstract = {Background: Many studies have examined the relationship between the food environment and health-related outcomes, but fewer consider the integrity of measures used to assess the food environment. The present review builds on and makes comparisons with a previous review examining food environment measures and expands the previous review to include a more in depth examination of reliability and validity of measures and study designs employed.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies measuring the food environment published between 2007 and 2015. We identified these articles through: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Global Health databases; tables of contents of relevant journals; and the National Cancer Institute's Measures of the Food Environment website. This search yielded 11,928 citations. We retained and abstracted data from 432 studies.
Results: The most common methodology used to study the food environment was geographic analysis (65\% of articles) and the domination of this methodology has persisted since the last review. Only 25.9\% of studies in this review reported the reliability of measures and 28.2\% reported validity, but this was an improvement as compared to the earlier review. Very few of the studies reported construct validity. Studies reporting measures of the school or worksite environment have decreased since the previous review. Only 13.9\% of the studies used a longitudinal design.
Conclusions: To strengthen research examining the relationship between the food environment and population health, there is a need for robust and psychometrically-sound measures and more sophisticated study designs.},

  volume = {136},
  abstract = {Food insecurity is a daily reality for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Although its most extreme manifestations are often obvious, many other households facing constraints in their access to food are less identifiable. Operational agencies lack a method for differentiating households at varying degrees of food insecurity in order to target and evaluate their interventions. This chapter provides an overview of a set of papers associated with a research initiative that seeks to identify more precise, yet simple, measures of household food insecurity. The overview highlights three main conceptual developments associated with practical approaches to measuring constraints in access to food: 1) a shift from using measures of food availability and utilization to measuring ``inadequate access''; 2) a shift from a focus on objective to subjective measures; and 3) a growing emphasis on fundamental measurement as opposed to reliance on distal, proxy measures. Further research is needed regarding 1) how well measures of household food insecurity designed for chronically food-insecure contexts capture the processes leading to, and experience of, acute food insecurity, 2) the impact of short-term shocks, such as major floods or earthquake, on household behaviors that determine responses to food security questions, 3) better measurement of the interaction between severity and frequency of household food insecurity behaviors, and 4) the determination of whether an individual's response to survey questions can be representative of the food insecurity experiences of all members of the household.

The extent to which a nation's population achieves food security is an indication of its material and social well-being. Differences in the prevalence of householdlevel food insecurity between Canada and the United States are described at the national level and for selected economic and demographic subpopulations. Associations of food security with economic and demographic characteristics are examined in multivariate analyses that hold other characteristics constant. Comparable measures of household food security were calculated from the nationally representative Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.2 (2004) and the U.S. Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement (2003-05). Based on the standard U.S. methodology, the percentage of the population living in households classified as food insecure was lower in Canada (7.0 percent) than in the United States (12.6 percent). The difference was greater for the percentage of children living in food-insecure households (8.3 percent vs. 17.9 percent) than for adults (6.6 percent vs. 10.8 percent). These differences primarily reflected different prevalence rates of food insecurity for Canadian and U.S. households with similar demographic and economic characteristics. Differences in population composition on measured economic and demographic characteristics account for only about 15 to 30 percent of the overall Canada-U.S. difference.},

  abstract = {The public sector in the United States has responded to growing concern about the social and environmental costs of sprawling development patterns by creating a wide range of policy instruments designed to manage urban growth and protect open space. These techniques have been implemented at the local, regional, state and, to a limited extent, national levels. This paper provides a systematic review of the extensive literature that describes these public policies and their implementation. The main public policy instruments for managing urban growth and protecting open space at various governmental levels are identified and briefly described, including public acquisition of land, regulatory approaches, and incentive-based approaches. Key lessons are gleaned from the literature on the implementation of growth management policies. Our assessment of lessons found: (1) a lack of empirical evaluations of growth management policies, (2) administrative efficiency and other details of policy implementation\textemdash{}rather than the general type of policy\textemdash{}are critical in determining their effectiveness, (3) the use of multiple policy instruments that reinforce and complement each other is needed to increase effectiveness and avoid unintended consequences, (4) vertical and horizontal coordination are critical for successful growth management but are often inadequate or lacking, and (5) meaningful stakeholder participation throughout the planning process and implementation is a cornerstone of effective growth management. Faced with a growing population and increasingly land consumptive development patterns, more effective policies and programs will be required to stem the tide of urban sprawl in the United States. We conclude with a discussion of potential federal roles in managing development and coordinating state, regional, and local growth management efforts. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

If it works with samples the size of typical national surveys, then MRP offers the possibility of analyzing many political phenomena previously believed to be outside the bounds of systematic empirical inquiry. Initial investigations of its performance with conventional national samples produce generally optimistic assessments. This article examines a larger number of cases and a greater range of opinions than in previous studies and finds substantial variation in MRP performance. Through empirical and Monte Carlo analyses, we develop an explanation for this variation. The findings suggest that the conditions necessary for MRP to perform well will not always be met. Thus, we draw a less optimistic conclusion than previous studies do regarding the use of MRP with samples of the size found in typical national surveys.},

  abstract = {Food insecurity refers to the inability to afford enough food for an active, healthy life. Numerous studies have shown associations between food insecurity and adverse health outcomes among children. Studies of the health effects of food insecurity among adults are more limited and generally focus on the association between food insecurity and self-reported disease. We therefore examined the association between food insecurity and clinical evidence of diet-sensitive chronic disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Our population-based sample included 5094 poor adults aged 18\textendash{}65 y participating in the NHANES (1999\textendash{}2004 waves). We estimated the association between food insecurity (assessed by the Food Security Survey Module) and self-reported or laboratory/examination evidence of diet-sensitive chronic disease using Poisson regression. We adjusted the models to account for differences in age, gender, race, educational attainment, and income. Food insecurity was associated with self-reported hypertension [adjusted relative risk (ARR) 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.04\textendash{}1.38] and hyperlipidemia (ARR 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.09\textendash{}1.55), but not diabetes (ARR 1.19; 95\% CI, 0.89\textendash{}1.58).

The association with laboratory evidence of diabetes did not reach significance in the fully adjusted model unless we used a stricter definition of food insecurity (ARR 2.42; 95\% CI, 1.44\textendash{}4.08). These data show that food insecurity is associated with cardiovascular risk factors.

Excluding the 11 severely insecure women, the prevalence of overweight among women increased as food insecurity increased, from 34\% for those who were food secure (n ϭ 3447), to 41\% for those who were mildly food insecure (n ϭ 966) and to 52\% for those who were moderately food insecure (n ϭ 86). Food insecurity remained a significant predictor of overweight status, after adjustment for potentially confounding demographic and lifestyle variables (P Ͻ 0.01). In a logistic regression analysis, mildly insecure women were 30\% more likely to be overweight than those who were food secure [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, P ϭ 0.005]. Thus, food insecurity had an unexpected and paradoxical association with overweight status among women with a higher prevalence of overweight among the food insecure, and a resulting potential for increased incidence of obesity-related chronic diseases. Given that the rates of both overweight and food insecurity are on the rise, this research area warrants further investigation. J. Nutr. 131: 1738 \textendash{}1745, 2001.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of household food security, which reflects adequacy and stability of the food supply, has been measured periodically in the United States and occasionally in high-risk groups or specific regions. Despite a plausible biological mechanism to suggest negative health outcomes of food insecurity, this relation has not been adequately evaluated. This study was conducted in the Lower Mississippi Delta region to examine the association between household food insecurity and self-reported health status in adults. A two-stage stratified cluster sample representative of the population in 36 counties in the Delta region of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi was selected using list-assisted random digit dialing telephone methodology. After households were selected and screened, a randomly selected adult was interviewed within each sampled household. Data were collected to measure food security status and self-reported mental, physical, and general health status, using the U.S. Food Security Survey Module and the Short Form 12-item Health Survey (SF-12). Data were reported on a sample of 1488 households. Adults in food-insecure households were significantly more likely to rate their health as poor/fair and scored significantly lower on the physical and mental health scales of the SF-12. In regression models controlling for income, gender, and ethnicity, the interaction between food insecurity status and race was a significant predictor of fair/poor health and lower scores on physical and mental health. Household food insecurity is associated with poorer self-reported health status of adults in this rural, high-risk sample in the Lower Mississippi Delta. J. Nutr. 134: 2330 \textendash{}2335, 2004.},

Included among these were 3.5 percent of households in which food insecurity was severe enough that one or more household members were hungry at least some time during the year due to inadequate resources for food. The prevalence of food insecurity and hunger varied considerably among States. Eleven States, located in an arc along the western and southern borders of the country, and the District of Columbia, had rates of food insecurity significantly above the national average. By contrast, 20 States--most of them in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast--had rates of food insecurity significantly below the national average. High-food-insecurity States generally had higher than average poverty rates and higher than average use of food stamps, but there were some notable exceptions.},

  abstract = {Background: Food insecurity is associated with adverse mental health outcomes. Given that federal food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aim to alleviate food insecurity, there may be heterogeneity in the association between food insecurity and depression by SNAP participation status.
Objective: With the use of data from the 2005\textendash{}2010 NHANES, we examined the associations between household food security and depression and whether these differed by SNAP participation.
Methods: The study population was restricted to 3518 adults with household incomes \#130\% of the federal poverty level. Food insecurity was assessed with the 18-item US Household Food Security Survey Module; a score of \$3 was considered food insecure. Depression was assessed with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and was defined as a score of \$10. Multivariate logistic regression models examined the associations between food insecurity and depression, adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics.
Results: The overall prevalence of depression was 9.3\%, ranging from 6.7\% among SNAP nonparticipants to 12.8\% among SNAP participants. For every depressive symptom, there was a dose-response relation, such that a higher prevalence was observed with worsening food insecurity. After multivariate adjustment, food insecurity was positively associated with depression (P-trend {$<$} 0.0001), but SNAP participation modified this relation (P-interaction = 0.03). Among low-income, eligible nonparticipants, very low food security was significantly associated with higher odds of depression (OR: 5.10; 95\% CI: 3.09, 8.41). Among SNAP participants, very low food security was also associated with higher odds of depression but at a lower magnitude (OR: 2.21; 95\% CI: 1.54, 3.17).
Conclusion: The complex relation between food insecurity and mental health may vary on the basis of SNAP participation status. Programmatic efforts to address the risk of depression among their beneficiaries may positively affect the mental health of low-income adults. J Nutr 2015;145:622\textendash{}7.},

Income, transportation, and distance may be barriers to food access for some. This brief updates estimates of low-income and low-supermarket-access census tracts (as found in ERS' Food Access Research Atlas) using a 2015 directory of supermarkets and 2010-2014 American Community Survey data on household vehicle access and family income. The number of tracts classified as low income (LI), based on the poverty rate and median income, increased 5.41 percent from 2010 to 2015. The number of tracts that are classified as low access (LA) solely by proximity to the nearest supermarket decreased from 2010 to 2015\textemdash{}that is, fewer tracts had a significant number or share of people more than 0.5 or 1.0 mile (10 or 20 miles) from the nearest supermarket in urban (rural) areas. For these proximity-only measures, the increase in low-income tracts outnumbered the decrease in low-access tracts so that there was a small net increase in the number of tracts that are both low-income and low-access (LILA) in 2015. The number of low-access tracts with a significant number of vehicle-less housing units more than 0.5 mile from the nearest supermarket grew by 412 from 2010 to 2015. This increase (4 percent) largely reflects lower levels of vehicle access across all U.S. housing units relative to 2010.},

  title = {Perceptions of {{Personal Safety}} in Relation to the {{Physical Environment}} of {{University Campuses}}},
  abstract = {This paper discusses research at the University of Glamorgan which focuses upon personal safety on the university campus, its immediate environments and access routes. The issue of personal safety is significant because of the design and layout of many university campuses and facilities. Campuses are often large open spaces and lack systematic access control, which may lead to a higher propensity for campus users to experience victimisation and fear. In addition, previous research has shown that university students are more at risk of being victimised than the general population. The primary objectives of the research were to identify areas of the campus that posed possible threat and vulnerability to campus users and to identify solutions in the form of design and management modifications that were based on users'perceptions of their personal safety. This user-led approach produced a number of cost-effective and achievable recommendations for modifications so that all users could feel safer, as well as a generic, evidence-based model for comparable universities to emulate. The initial research determined the most common routes around campus used by three discrete user groups: staff, students and visitors. From this analysis representative routes were selected for each user group. A digital camera was used to take a number of 360\textdegree{} panoramas at key points along the routes which were then `knitted together' using QuickTime software to produce a 2-dimensional virtual representation of the routes. These `virtual reality'walk-through scenes of the routes were presented to focus groups where perceptions of personal safety were discussed. Possible solutions to personal safety concerns were considered in the form of the design and maintenance of existing facilities. Key findings from the preliminary research have identified a hierarchy of concerns and some practical recommendations that would improve campus safety. These were concerned with improving visibility, the issue of empty spaces and the need for more effective security measures. The methodology forms a cost-effective, versatile and insightful research tool that can be used to explore personal safety concerns in relation to the facilities of any organisation or environment.},

The core components we examine include the different bases of identity (category/group or role) in each of the theories, identity salience and the activation of identities as discussed in the theories, and the cognitive and motivational processes that emerge from identities based on category/group and on role. By examining the self through the lens of both identity theory and social identity theory, we see how, in combination, they can move us toward a general theory of the self.},

This article makes use of a unique data set collected using a dynamic information board experiment to test important effects of motivated reasoning. In particular, affective biases should cause citizens to take longer processing information incongruent with their existing affect and such biases should also direct search for new information about candidates. Somewhat perversely, motivated reasoners may actually increase their support of a positively evaluated candidate upon learning new negatively evaluated information. Findings are reported that support all of these expectations. Additional analysis shows that these affective biases may easily lead to lower quality decision making, leading to a direct challenge to the notion of voters as rational Bayesian updaters.},

We address these arguments using data from nine experiments carried out in three household surveys. Attraction to no-opinion options was found to be greatest among respondents lowest in cognitive skills (as measured by educational attainment), among respondents answering secretly instead of orally, for questions asked later in a survey, and among respondents who devoted little effort to the reporting process. The quality of attitude reports obtained (as measured by over-time consistency and responsiveness to a question manipulation) was not compromised by the omission of noopinion options. These results suggest that inclusion of no-opinion options in attitude measures may not enhance data quality and instead may preclude measurement of some meaningful opinions.},

However, research result on the effectiveness of this technique are inconsistent. This study teste whether the effectiveness of forgiving introductions depends on individua differences in respondents' social desirability response style (SDRS) an developmental status. In an online survey among 3,802 respondents aged 12 to 89 years, we conducted an experiment with a one-factor (forgivin introduction vs. no forgiving introduction) between-subjects design. Us of sexual media content was our target sensitive behavior. Including a forgiving introduction had no main effect on the reporting of sensitiv behavior overall, but depended on respondents' SDRS: when a forgivin introduction was included in the questions, respondents high in SDRS reported more sensitive behavior than did respondents low in SDRS. Thi effect further depended on respondents' developmental status. Forgivin introductions increased the reporting of sensitive behavior among adole cents and emerging adults (i.e., 12- to 25-year-olds) high in SDRS, but caused little differences in the reporting of such behavior among adult (i.e., people older than 25).},

Yet what the field collectively believes about this construct is based on dozens of studies using different indicators of knowledge. We identify two theoretically relevant dimensions: a *temporal* dimension that corresponds to the time when a fact was established and a *topical* dimension that relates to whether the fact is policy-specific or general. The resulting typology yields four types of knowledge questions. In an anlalysis of more than 300 knowledge items from late in the first decade of the 2000s, we examine whether classic findings regarding the predictors of knowledge withstand differences across types of questions. In the case of education and the mass media, the mechanisms for becoming informed operate differently across question types. However, differences in the levels of knowledge between men and women are robust, reinforcing the importance of including gneder-relevant items in knowledge batteries.},

An analysis of mas media coverage during the peak years of the debate over gay rights (1990-97) showed that the implications of moral traditionalism were virtually undisputed in this debate, whereas both sides laid claim to egalitarianism. Analysis of American National Election Studies surve data demonstrated that in 1992 and 1996 the impact of moral traditionalism on public opinion grew stronger as political knowledge increased, whereas the impact of egalitarianism did not vary across leve of knowledge. Thus, the results suggest that the extent to which politica knowledge moderates a value's effect on opinion can depend on wheth public debate provides an undisputed frame or competing frames fo that value. One could, in turn, frame the implications of this finding fo democratic politics in more than one way.},

  abstract = {Social identity theorists have long studied identity as one of the prime determinants of behavior. However, political scientists have had a hard time identifying consistent patterns between ethnic identity and political participation, especially among immigrants. In this paper, we take a more complex approach and explore whether a sense of immigrant linked fate is salient in explaining political participation among immigrants and, further, what may have caused immigrant identity to become so politicized. Specifically, we look at the issue of immigration reform in 2011 and 2012, and the manner in which both positive and negative messages were a catalyst for a politicized immigrant identity, and the resulting mobilizing effects. Using the 2012 Latino Immigrant National Election Study data, we argue that exposure to Spanish-language news media and feelings of immigrant-linked fate created a politicized immigrant identity among Latino immigrants, which resulted in greater political participation and civic engagement. Rather than seeing immigrants as low-resourced and unengaged in American politics, our theory of politicized immigrant identity explains that Latino immigrants draw on their identity as immigrants and as Americans to participate in their new homeland.},

Instead of taking consum sentiment at the fully aggregated level, as is customary, we disaggrega by party in order to see the effects of partisanship on over-time eval ations of the economy. Analyzing four presidential administrations' worth of public opinion data, we find that differences in Republican and Democrats' beliefs about the changing economy do not cancel in t aggregate. Furthermore, our macroanalysis shows that the endogeneit of consumer sentiment to partisanship leads to a clear overestimate the role of consumer sentiment on approval of the president's handlin of the economy.},

People believe they have been excluded from current processes, but they do not want direct democracy. The extent to which individuals believe actual processes are inconsistent with their own process preferences is an important variable in understanding the current public mood. Moreover, individual-level differences in level of dissatisfaction with democratic processes help explain variations in public approval of govemment and in willingness to comply with the outputs of govemment. Of course, many political attitudes and behaviors are influenced by fondness for the policies that government produces, but it is also the case that sentiments and actions are affected by the way government produces those policies. Far from being merely a means to a policy end, governmental process is important in its own right.},

This study examined whether authoritarians' attitudes have been influenced by the societal shift toward greater acceptance of sexual minorities. Using data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) collected between 1992 and 2012, we tested a model in which authoritarianism, endorsement of egalitarian values, and social norms shifting in the direction of tolerance predict individual attitudes toward sexual minorities and LGBT rights issues. Results indicated that (1) there was a subset of authoritarians who endorsed egalitarian values, (2) authoritarians in general became more tolerant (i.e., held less negative attitudes) toward sexual minorities between 1992 and 2012, and (3) ``egalitarian authoritarians'' held more positive attitudes toward sexual minorities than other authoritarians. The findings contribute to contemporary theory and research on authoritarianism, which is moving from a monolithic view of authoritarianism to one in which culture and core values activate and shape manifestations of authoritarian tendencies.},

The origins and nature of public opinion have long attracted the attention of social scientists. Yet a number of questions remain ; among the more perplexing is whether - and under what conditions - public opinion is stable. The answer depends in large part on whether one looks at aggregations of individual opinions (macro public opinion) or at the individual opinions themselves (micro public opinion). In this essay, we explore the macro/micro divide and offer a framework to determine when opinions are likely to be stable or volatile. Thisframework reflects both the content of the political environment and the nature of individuals' opinions. Using public opinion dynamics surrounding the Patriot Act as a primary example, we discuss the role of opinion stability in interpreting public opinion and in understanding the normative implications of public preferences.},

 cyclical pattern over time. All Presidents begin their terms with great popularity,
 experience parabolic declines, steadily lose popular support for about three

The extraordinary fit of parabolic curves to actual presidential approval leads to the suspicion that presidential approval may be almost wholly independent of the President's behavior in office, a function largely of inevitable forces associated with time.},

 nation systems and the ambitious politicians competing within those systems encourage activists with extreme views on a variety of issue dimensions to become involved in party politics, thus motivating candidates to take noncentrist positions on a range of issues. Once that happens, continuing activists with strong partisan commitments bring their views into line with the new candidate agendas, thus extending the domain of interparty conflict. Using cross-sectional and panel surveys of national convention delegates, we find clear evidence for conflict extension among party activists, evidence tentatively suggesting a leading role for activists in partisan conflict extension more generally, and strong support for our argument about change among continuing activists. Issue conversion among activists has contributed substantially to conflict extension and party commitment has played a key role in motivating that conversion.},

We examine how and under what conditions actions of the national government influence the diffusion of policy across the states. We test our hypotheses on the cases of the diffusion of partial birth abortion laws, truth-in-sentencing laws, and hate crime laws using event history analysis on pooled cross-sectional data from the 50 states. Our results suggest that, in addition to fiscal incentives, the national government can influence state policymaking when it sends strong, clear signals to the states concerning its preferences and the potential for future action. But even national-level signals that are weak and ambiguous may influence state policymaking indirectly.},

  abstract = {While John Kingdon's Multiple Streams Approach (MSA) remains a key reference point in the public policy literature, few have attempted to assess MSA holistically. To assess its broader impact and trends in usage, we combine in-depth analysis of representative studies, with comprehensive coverage of MSA-inspired articles, to categorize its impact. We find that Kingdon's work makes two separate contributions. First, it has contributed to the development of ``evolutionary'' policy theories such as punctuated equilibrium. Second, it has prompted a large, dedicated, and often empirical, literature. However, most MSA empirical applications only engage with broader policy theory superficially. The two contributions are oddly independent of each other. We argue that these trends in application are due largely to its intuitive appeal and low ``barrier to entry.'' Drawing on other policy approaches, we offer suggestions to improve the MSAinspired literature.},

Using national surveys and advances in subnational opinion estimation, we estimate state-level support for 39 policies across eight issue areas, including abortion, law enforcement, health care, and education. We show that policy is highly responsive to policy-specific opinion, even controlling for other influences.
But we also uncover a striking  democratic deficit'': policy is congruent with majority will only half the time. The analysis considers the influence of institutions, salience, partisan control of government, and interest groups on the magnitude and ideological direction of this democratic deficit. We find the largest influences to be legislative professionalization, term limits, and issue salience. Partisanship and interest groups affect the ideological balance of incongruence more than the aggregate degree thereof. Finally, policy is overresponsive to ideology and party\textemdash{}leading policy to be polarized relative to
state electorates.},

Our dynamic measure of state policy liberalism marks an important advance over existing measures, almost all of which are purely cross-sectional and thus cannot be used to study policy change. We find that, in the aggregate, the policy liberalism of U.S. states steadily increased between the 1930s and 1970s and then largely plateaued. The policy liberalism of most states has remained stable in relative terms, though several states have shifted considerably over time. We also find surprisingly little evidence of multidimensionality in state policy outputs. Our new estimates of state policy liberalism have broad application to the study of political development, representation, accountability, and other important issues in political science.},

After discussing descriptive statistics, the analysis uses a time series regression model to explain budget change, with media attention to urban issues, public opinion on economic issues, unemployment, partisan control, and measures of urban riots as the explanatory terms. The paper finds that the media agenda and the key riot year of 1981 are the best explanations of budget levels.},

Whereas existing comparative policy studies tend to focus on how institutional or programmatic differences affect policy and politics, we begin by asking how the issue itself affects politics across nations. We illustrate by comparing health care attention and policy developments in Denmark and the US over fifty years. These two industrialized democracies have very different political and health care systems. Nevertheless, similar trends in political attention to health emerge. We argue that these high levels of attention reflect the issue's political attractiveness with regard to vote-seeking and the fact that neither system has managed to resolve the basic dilemma of how to control costs while meeting public expectations concerning access to services and health care quality.},

  abstract = {Research on media framing of policy issues has flourished. Yet the varied approaches to conceptualizing and operationalizing issue frames that make this literature rich also hinder its advancement. Here, we document the benefits of a two-tiered method: the first level accounts for issue-specific frames, while the second level tracks frames that generalize across issues. For this study, we draw on generalizable frames from prospect theory (loss vs. gain frames) and social identity theory (self-referential vs. otherreferential frames). We discuss the theoretical merits of a two-tiered approach, arguing that it should yield compound insights greater than the sum of its parts. Applying this method to newspaper coverage of the war on terror, we find a strong trend at the generalizable level: media framing of the war shifted over time from a predominant use of ``fear'' (self-referential loss) frames to an increasing use of ``charity'' (other-referential gain) frames. Our approach further reveals that the fear frames used in the lead-up to the Iraq War were not driven by issue-specific frames related to terrorism or weapons of mass destruction as we might have thought, but rather by frames related to the anticipated threats to U.S. troops. This study sharpens our understanding of how framing of the war evolved, but more broadly it suggests that a two-tiered approach could be applied both within and across policy issues to advance our understanding of the framing process.},

Opponents of abortion adopted a strategy of ``legal but inaccessible'' that has resulted in the passage of more than 700 state laws since the early 1990s. Despite being a very active area of policy making, we lack a coherent explanation for the proliferation of abortion policy. Scholars studying different policies at discrete moments in time have come to conflicting conclusions about how well theories of morality policy and representation explain abortion policy. Using an original dataset comprised of a nearuniverse of pro- and anti-abortion rights policy from 1973 to 2013, I establish the ways in which partisan control of the government and the moral preferences of constituents shape state policy. I find that anti-abortion rights policies are well explained by both theories but that pro-abortion rights policies are not well explained as a morality policy or with descriptive representation. In addition, I show the heterogeneous effect of representation across anti-abortion rights policies; Democratic women and governors decrease the probability of only certain anti-abortion rights policies.},

Research on issue definitions has been divided between a macro level that examines collective issue definitions and a micro level focusing on the ways in which policy actors frame policy issues. This article develops a model of issue definitions that assumes issues are multidimensional, competition exists among policy actors in defining issues, and that collective issue definitions can be understood as the aggregation of individual issue definitions. This model is then estimated using quantitative text analysis. While various approaches to text analysis and categorization have been used by scholars, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a specific type of topic modeling, is used to estimate issue definitions. Using LDA, witness testimony taken from Congressional hearings that occurred from 1975 to 2012 about the issue of used nuclear fuel (UNF) is examined and seven distinct dimensions of the UNF debate are estimated. The construct validity of these dimensions is checked by testing them against two major policy changes that occurred in the UNF domain. I conclude with a discussion of the strengths and weakness of topic modeling, and how this approach could be used to test hypotheses drawn from several of the major policymaking theories.},

We examine policy response to an alternative dimension of public mood, public preferences for more or less punit criminal justice policies, using multiple indicators of policy from various stages the policy-making process. Criminal justice policy should be responsive to public preferences given the public's concern about crime and the negative social c struction of criminals. Thus, there is an electoral incentive for public officials respond to public preferences along this alternative dimension of public sentim regarding criminal justice policy. We estimate a DYMIMIC model of feder criminal justice policy as a function of the multiple dimensions of public policy mood using Kaiman filtering. The results indicate that criminal justice pol responds to the second, not the first, dimension of public mood. We find evide that policy-makers at multiple stages of the policy process are able to differentia among multiple signals from the public and respond appropriately.

We draw from theories of neoinstitutional organization, group threat, and political incorporation. Multivariate analysis suggest that the severity of states' penal regimes and the degree to which felons and poor people threaten social order have the greatest influence on states' responses to the federal sanctions on drug felons. Our study informs understandings of why some states take a ``punitive turn'' while other states may counter convention, exercising discretion to reduce rather than increase their punitiveness toward felons specifically and lawbreaking generally.},

Other scholars counter that deference to elites perpetuates and even exacerbates the problem. Here we look at school choice programs as an environment to elucidate this important debate. Theories of school choice suggest that parents need to and can make informed decisions. Choice parents should have more incentives to gather information about their child's schools than parents without schooling options. Alternatively, a lack of any increase in information levels among school choosers would suggest that having choices per se is not sufficient motivation to overcome the costs of information gathering. Analyzing data from an experimental evaluation of the Washington Scholarship Fund, we find that presenting parents with choices does lead to significantly higher levels of accurate information on measures of important school characteristics.},

@article{mooney_does_2008,
  title = {Does {{Morality Policy Exist}}? {{Testing}} a {{Basic Assumption}}},
  volume = {36},
  abstract = {Does morality policy exist? A growing body of scholarship has examined the ways that the politics of so-called "morality policy" (e.g. abortion regulation, same-sex marriage policy, and capital punishment) differ fro mthe politics of other types of policy. In this literature, morality poicies are assumed to be distinctive in that they generate conflicts of basic moral values, do not lend themselves to compromise, and are widely salient and technically simple. Using an email survey of morality policy scholars and a telephone survey of just over seven hundred Illinois residents in 2005, we test this assumption. We find that citizen responses about these policies vary along three of these four characteristics, just as morality policy scholars predicted. Thus, morality policies do exist, as assumed by these scholars. Our analysis also suggests some potentially fruitful avenues for future research on morality policy and other policy typologies.},

Based on qualitative and quantitative evidence from media coverage and congressional hearings, we conclue that policy change was influenced by the redefinition of disability issues from medical and economic definitions to a new sociopolitical persepctive. Specifically, we find evidence that media attention and tone influenced the number of congressional hearings and hte tone of these hearings. The chnage in the congressional definition subsequently contributed to the passage of key legislation based on the sociopolitical/civl rights definition of disability. Importantly, our research supports previous studies that suggest problem definition helps to explain significant policy change.},

  abstract = {The simplistic, but still influential, idea of a clear-cut boundary between science and politics does not capture the complexities of the ongoing ``dialogue between science and politics.'' Neither do political scientists live in an ivory tower, nor do they breathe the air of a separate world. However, the relation between political science practitioners and the rest of the world remains knotty. In this contribution we outline the value of a focus on ``practical reflexivity'' to assist in the dialogue with political practice. Based on proposals from social theory we evaluate six strategies of coping with the dilemmas of engaging with practice. The strategies provide a menu of choice for political scientists, as well as systematization of furthering the discussion on practical reflexivity.},

We reject the notion of neoliberal inevitability and suggest how it came to dominate all other possible alternatives. The review emphasizes the critical importance of political preferences and influences as well as the central role ideas played in defining policy paradigms.},

This article conceptualizes neo-liberalism as a sui generis ideological system born of struggle and collaboration in three worlds: intellectual, bureaucratic and political. Emphasizing neo-liberalism's third `face', it argues that a failure to grasp neo-liberalism as a political form imposes two limitations on understanding its effects: (i) fostering an implicit assumption that European political elites are `naturally' opposed to the implementation of neo-liberal policies; and (ii) tending to preempt inquiry into an unsettling fact\textemdash{}namely, that the most effective advocates of policies understood as neo-liberal in Western Europe (and beyond) have often been elites who are sympathetic to, or are representatives of, the left and centre-left. Given that social democratic politics were uniquely powerful in Western Europe for much of the post-war period, neo-liberalism within the mainstream parties of the European left deserves particular attention.},

  abstract = {The anthropology of neoliberalism has become polarised between a hegemonic economic model anchored by variants of market rule and an insurgent approach fuelled by derivations of the Foucaultian notion of governmentality. Both conceptions obscure what is `neo' about neoliberalism: the reengineering and redeployment of the state as the core agency that sets the rules and fabricates the subjectivities, social relations and collective representations suited to realising markets. Drawing on two decades of field-based inquiries into the structure, experience and political treatment of urban marginality in advanced society, I propose a via media between these two approaches that construes neoliberalism as an articulation of state, market and citizenship that harnesses the first to impose the stamp of the second onto the third. Bourdieu's concept of bureaucratic field offers a powerful tool for dissecting the revamping of the state as stratification and classification machine driving the neoliberal revolution from above and serves to put forth three theses: (1) neoliberalism is not an economic regime but a political project of state-crafting that puts disciplinary `workfare', neutralising `prisonfare' and the trope of individual responsibility at the service of commodification; (2) neoliberalism entails a rightward tilting of the space of bureaucratic agencies that define and distribute public goods and spawns a Centaur-state that practises liberalism at the top of the class structure and punitive paternalism at the bottom; (3) the growth and glorification of the penal wing of the state is an integral component of the neoliberal Leviathan, such that the police, courts and prison need to be brought into the political anthropology of neoliberal rule.},

Using ethnographic methods and a count of ER admission decisions (N = 1,114), this article describes the continual rushing and delaying of medical resources to patients based on their perceived criminality or actual relationship to the criminal justice system. These dynamics develop through four processes: (1) widespread administration of pain medication, which associates waiting patients with criminal narcotics; (2) deployment of criminal stigma along race and gender lines to select some qualified patients over others; (3) patrolling of waiting rooms by police; and (4) rushing of beds to vast numbers of arrestees, inmates, and witnesses. Key to these findings is that if the urban poor happen to be wards of the criminal justice system, they receive rushed health care resources, but if they enter health care organizations on their own accord they are policed, delayed, and deterred from accessing care.},

We administered the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults to assess general health literacy as a standalone factor related to cervical health promotion. Ninety-one percent of participants had adequate health literacy scores. However, we found that the women had varying levels of cervical health literacy, which we operationalized as knowledge, beliefs, and self-efficacy related to cervical health promotion. Practitioners should establish broader interventions to empower women with criminal justice histories to take control of their own cervical health and focus on communicating updated recommendations to improve cervical health understanding, beliefs, and practices among high-risk women.},

  abstract = {This article draws upon recent works in sociology, jurisprudence, and feminist theory in order to assess the ways in which feminism, and sex and gender more generally, have become intricately interwoven with punitive agendas in contemporary US politics. Melding existing theoretical discussions of penal trends with insights drawn from my own ethnographic research on the contemporary anti-trafficking movement in the United States\textemdash{}the most recent domain of feminist activism in which a crime frame has prevailed against competing models of social justice\textemdash{}I elaborate upon the ways that neoliberalism and the politics of sex and gender have intertwined to produce a carceral turn in feminist advocacy movements previously organized around struggles for economic justice and liberation. Taking the anti-trafficking movement as a case study, I further demonstrate how human rights discourse has become a key vehicle both for the transnationalization of carceral politics and for the reincorporation of these policies into the domestic terrain in a benevolent, feminist guise. I conclude by urging greater and more nuanced attention to the operations of gender and sexual politics within mainstream analyses of contemporary modes of punishment, as well as a careful consideration of the neoliberal carceral state within feminist discussions of gender, sexuality, and the law.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Governmentalities}} of {{Neoliberalism}}},
  abstract = {This paper draws on the writings of Michel Foucault, in particular his lectures on biopolitics at the Coll{\`e}ge de France from 1978\textendash{}79, to examine liberalism and neoliberalism as governmental forms that operate through different models of surveillance. First, this paper re-reads Foucault's Discipline and Punish in the light of his analysis of the art of liberal government that is advanced through the course of these lectures. It is argued that the Panopticon is not just an architecture of power centred on discipline and normalization, as is commonly understood, but a normative model of the relation of the state to the market which, for Foucault, is `the very formula of liberal government'. Second, the limits of panopticism, and by extension liberal governance, are explored through analysis of Gilles Deleuze's account of the shift from disciplinary to `control' societies, and Zygmunt Bauman's writings on individualization and the `Synopticon'. In response to Deleuze and Bauman, the final section of this paper returns to Foucault's lectures on biopolitics to argue that contemporary capitalist society is characterized not simply by the decline of state powers (the control society) or the passing down of responsibilities from the state to the individual (the individualization thesis), but by the neoliberal marketization of the state and its institutions; a development which is underpinned by a specific form of governmentality. In conclusion, a four-fold typology of surveillance is advanced: surveillance as discipline, as control, as interactivity, and as a mechanism for promoting competition. It is argued that while these types of surveillance are not mutually exclusive, they are underpinned by different governmentalities that can be used to address different aspects of the relationship between the state and the market, and with this the social and cultural logics of contemporary forms of market capitalism more broadly.},

Our interpretive analysis of a set of offender narratives identifies a theme we call ``transforming the self'' that illustrates the ways in which house arrest is experienced by some clients as a set of discourses and practices that encourages them to govern themselves by regulating their own bodies and conduct. These self-governing capabilities include ``enterprise,'' ``autonomy,'' and an ethical stance towards their lives.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the development of a new logic of labor and surveillance: the application of Crowdsourcing, an approach of distributive, collaborative labor over web-based networks, to the defense of the U.S.-Mexico border. I explore this issue through the case of the Texas Virtual BorderWatch, a network of governmental web-based surveillance cameras mounted at the U.S.-Mexico Border that can be patrolled by anyone with an internet connection. Programs such as the Texas Virtual BorderWatch have proven to be neither particularly effective nor cost-efficient, yet they continue, leading the question of what other logics must justify the sustained funding of these types of programs? I argue that the crowdsourcing of border security represents a new trajectory in the approach to governance and surveillance under Neoliberalism, able to use the power of participatory platforms developed under Web 2.0 as tools to offload the responsibilities of surveillance and security from the state to the populace at little to no cost. Furthermore, the Texas Virtual BorderWatch creates participatory ``citizen-soldiers'' in the War on Terror, able to welcome the front lines of surveillance into the household, among the most private of spaces. Yet in each case, these practices serve as but one example of the type of decentralized, interactive experiments of reproducing power dynamics that are representative of the Neoliberal movement's aim to politicize the cultural practices of everyday life.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed a double movement within the field of crime control characterized by the prison boom and intensive policing, on the one hand, and widespread implementation of new approaches that assign policing responsibilities to non-police actors, on the other. The latter development has been accomplished by expansion of thirdparty policing policies; nuisance property ordinances, which sanction landlords for their tenants' behavior, are among the most popular. This study, an analysis of every nuisance citation distributed in Milwaukee over a two-year period, is among the first to evaluate empirically the impact of coercive third-party policing on the urban poor. Properties in black neighborhoods disproportionately received citations, and those located in more integrated black neighborhoods had the highest likelihood of being deemed nuisances. Nearly a third of all citations were generated by domestic violence; most property owners abated this ``nuisance'' by evicting battered women. Landlords also took steps to discourage tenants from calling 911; overrepresented among callers, women were disproportionately affected by these measures. By looking beyond traditional policing, this study reveals previously unforeseen consequences of new crime control strategies for women from inner-city neighborhoods.},

Indeed, by focusing so effectively on their political marginalization, political scientists have ironically made such communities marginal to the subfield's account of American democracy and citizenship. In this article, we provide a corrective by focusing on what is present in the political lives of such communities. To redress the current imbalance and advance the understandings of race and class in American politics, we argue that studies of the liberal-democratic ``first face'' of the state must be complemented by greater attention to the state's more controlling ``second face.'' Focusing on policing, we seek to unsettle the mainstream of a subfield that rarely inquires into governmental practices of social control and the ways ``race-class subjugated communities'' are governed through coercion, containment, repression, surveillance, regulation, predation, discipline, and violence.},

  abstract = {A new debate emerged in the 1990s about regional solutions to urban problems. The debate has been carried out overwhelmingly within a welfare economics framework that stresses the economic costs and benefits of regional governance structures. Unlike earlier debates about regional reforms, the new regionalists emphasize not just that more collaborative regional governance structures will improve local services but that they will enhance the competitiveness of regions in the global economy as well. The article surveys the evidence on two propositions put forth by the new regionalists: 1) whether fragmented regional governance harms economic growth; and 2) whether suburbs are dependent on cities for their economic well-being. Neither proposition is well supported by research and even if they were, the author concludes, this would not necessarily persuade citizens to support regional reforms. Research on the economic effects of regional governance needs to be supplemented with research on its political effects. The article concludes by examining the effects of regional governance structures on three core American political values.},

Where the export sector is thriving, international trade and investment are creating more and better paying jobs. U.S. cities will have to adjust quickly to these and other international forces. To grow and prosper, metropolitan areas must improve their education systems to produce a highly skilled and flexible work force, improve the quality of living conditions to attract international investment, provide services and infrastructure to support globally competitive firms, and develop stronger entrepreneurial and technological capacity among small and medium-size companies. Civic leadership and community action are essential to expanding and modernizing urban infrastructure, strengthening mechanisms of community cooperation within metropolitan areas, and fostering public-private partnerships to expand opportunities for employment. Demands for integrating the inner-city poor into economic activities will require innovative policies that build on business-oriented approaches to community development.},

  abstract = {Compared to other economically advanced democracies, the United States is uniquely prone to adversarial, legalistic modes of policy formulation and implementation, shaped by the prospect of judicial review. While adversarial legalism facilitates the expression of justice-claims and challenges to official dogma, its costs are often neglected or minimized. A survey ofexisting research, together with a case study of environmental regulation in the Port of Oakland, indicates the extent to which adversarial legalism causes (or threatens) enormous dispute-resolving costs and procedural delays, which in turn distort policy outcomes. Adversarial legalism, moreover, has increased in recent decades, as Americans have attempted to implement the ambitious, socially transformative policies of activist government through political structures, forms of legislation, and legal procedures that reflect deep suspicion of governmental authority.},

Looked at comparatively, the American state is anything but small or weak. Rather, befitting a federal system, public authority in the United States is exercised largely through state and local government. What is distinctive about the American state is the concentration of public-sector employment in three areas: education, defense, and public safety. This pattern reflects a historical legacy of American state-building whereby the federal government frequently employed less visible, indirect forms of policy intervention while state and local government developed robust authority, particularly in matters that pertained to public and private morals. The result has been a set of institutions that hides or conceals public authority in various ways. Ultimately, the inability of Americans to see this state reinforces the very skepticism toward governmental authority that such a state-building strategy was meant to avoid.},

  abstract = {Racist and liberal ideals are said to anchor competing political traditions in America, but a juxtaposition of ideals obscures key processes of change in the cultural lexicon and misses much about how a political tradition comes to bear on the development of a polity. Attention to the reassociation of ideas and purposes over time points to a more intimate relationship between racism and liberalism in American political culture, to the conceptual interpenetration of these antithetical ends. Cuing off issues that have long surrounded the reassociation of John C. Calhoun's rule of the concurrent majority with pluralist democracy, this article examines another southerner, Woodrow Wilson, who, in the course of defending racial hierarchy, developed ideas that became formative of modern American liberalism. Analysis of the movement of ideas across purposes shifts the discussion of political traditions from set categories of thought to revealed qualities of thought, bringing to the for aspects of this policy that are essentially and irreducibly "American."},

  abstract = {Mayhew's (1974) thesis regarding the ``electoral connection'' and its impact on legislative behavior has become the theoretical foundation for much of the research on the contemporary U.S. Congress. Recently, scholars have begun to suggest that the Mayhewian electoral incentive may apply to politics in earlier congressional eras as well. To assess these claims more systematically, we consider four conditions that serve as the building blocks of the electoral connection\textemdash{}ambition, autonomy, responsiveness, and accountability. Through a detailed review of the literature on electoral politics in Congress, we discover that all four conditions were present in a strict sense as far back as the Progressive Era. Moreover, considerable evidence suggests that a weaker, less formalized version of the electoral connection existed even earlier in American history. We conclude by briefly discussing the implications of these findings on the rapidly growing literature examining the historical and institutional evolution of Congress.},

This empirical exploration allows us to place Polsby's findings in broader historical context and to assess whether the House has continued along the ``institutionalization course'' \textemdash{} using metrics that quantify the degree to which the House has erected impermeable boundaries with other institutions, created a complex institution, and adopted universalistic decisionmaking criteria. Empirically we document that careerism bottomed-out right at the point Polsby wrote ``Institutionalization,'' and that the extension of the careerism trend has affected Democrats more than Republicans. The House remains complex, but lateral movement between the committee and party leadership systems began to re-establish itself a decade after Institutionalization was published. Finally, the seniority system as a mechanism for selecting committee chairs \textemdash{} the primary measure of universalistic decisionmaking criteria \textemdash{} has been almost thoroughly demolished. Thus, most of the trends Polsby identified have moderated, but have not been overturned. We conclude by considering the larger set of interpretive issues that our empirical investigation poses.},

  abstract = {Both pundits and scholars have blamed increasing levels of partisan conflict and polarization in Congress on the effects
of partisan gerrymandering. We assess whether there is a strong causal relationship between congressional districting and polarization. We find very little evidence for such a link. First, we show that congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences. Second, we conduct simulations to gauge the
level of polarization under various ``neutral'' districting procedures. We find that the actual levels of polarization are not much higher than those produced by the simulations. We do find that gerrymandering has increased the Republican seat share in the House; however, this increase is not an important source of polarization.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this review is to take stock of how party polarization affects governance in the United States. The article begins by defining polarization and discussing the means by which it can be measured. It is undeniable that the two parties have grown more sharply differentiated. Some evidence suggests that the substantive policy preferences of liberals and conservatives diverge more widely, but the case for ideological polarization in the spatial sense is not definitive. Effects on the institutional processes of US government have entailed a hardening of party divisions and a tendency toward centralization of power. Nevertheless, these more cohesive parties are not more effective than their predecessors at enacting policies or managing routine governing responsibilities. The consequences for public policy seem best characterized as ``drift'' (Hacker 2004, p. 246). There is little evidence that party polarization has promoted ideologically extreme policy outcomes or has systematically advantaged either liberalism or conservatism.},

  abstract = {In this study, we use institutional theory to explore how institutional pressures exerted on four state governments (New York, Michigan, Ohio, Delaware) influenced the decision of these governments to adopt or resist the use of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for external financial reporting. We identify resource dependence as a potent form of coercive institutional pressure that was associated with early GAAP adoption. We identify three factors that may lead to initial resistance to institutional pressures for change. First, if accounting bureaucrats are not active in professional associations that promote GAAP adoption, they may miss the educational process that we believe is important to early adoption of GAAP. Second, organizational printing may impede GAAP adoption. Third, powerful interests may impede GAAP if the proposed GAAP legislation is expected to alter the existing power relationships. We found that key accounting bureaucrats in New York and Michigan used ``compromise'' as an initial strategic response to institutional pressures to adopt GAAP, Ohio's key accounting bureaucrat adopted a ``defy'' strategy, although the political leadership endorsed an ``acquiesce'' strategy. While Delaware initially employed a ``manipulate''strategy with some success. Delaware did not adopt GAAP for external reporting until a political entrepreneur for GAAP emerged in the early 1990s. Our study suggests that all strategic responses to resist institutional pressures for GAAP adoption will ultimately fail because of the potency of the institutional pressures that result from the well organized professional accounting and governmental institutional \textregistered{}elds. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Faced with long intervals between federal minimum wage increases in recent years, state legislatures are increasingly likely to take action. Motivated by the relative dearth of empirical work on minimum wages in the American states, this article considered various explanations to determine which factors are associated with legislative efforts to pass wage increases. Taking seriously the view that disagreements over the effects of minimum wage increases enhances the influence of political factors, we drew on the policy adoption and diffusion literature to examine how internal determinants (political and economic variables) and regional diffusion pressures relate to both the introduction and adoption of minimum wage legislation in the American states in the years between the last two federal minimum wage increases (1997\textendash{}2006). Employing negative binomial regression to analyze annual bill introductions, we found that a number of political variables are related to the consideration of minimum wage increases. However, using event history analysis to examine annual adoptions of minimum wage increases, we found few of the same variables matter. We concluded with a discussion of the empirical results within the context of the broader policy literature and cautioned future scholars to consider seriously whether political factors exert distinct influences at different stages of the policy process.},

These combined market failures provide a strong rationale for a portfolio of public policies that foster emissions reduction as well as the development and adoption of environmentally beneficial technology. Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that the rate and direction of technological advance is influenced by market and regulatory incentives, and can be cost-effectively harnessed through the use of economic-incentive based policy. In the presence of weak or nonexistent environmental policies, investments in the development and diffusion of new environmentally beneficial technologies are very likely to be less than would be socially desirable. Positive knowledge and adoption spillovers and information problems can further weaken innovation incentives. While environmental technology policy is fraught with difficulties, a long-term view suggests a strategy of experimenting with policy approaches and systematically evaluating their success.},

In general, previous social equity measures have focused largely on measuring the extent to which disparities exist. More recently, tools and resources have become available to assist local governments in designing and evaluating their approach and performance in reducing social inequities. Future evidence should include more standardized measures to benchmark success, provide comparative analysis, and better support the identification of best practices.},

Our findings indicate that publicness at the organizational and state policy levels are both important determinants of the offering of public service practices. Generally, we find that privately owned organizations are more likely to offer these services when they operate in policy environments with greater publicness. However, we also find that private organizations are less likely to offer public services that result in clear economic loss if they operate in policy environments with a greater number of public organizations.},

We present an exploratory quantitative examination of this argument, using primary and secondary data from 46 UK local government service departments. The results indicate that public-public partnership is positively associated with effectiveness, efficiency, and equity, but that public-private partnership is negatively associated with effectiveness and equity. Public-nonprofit partnership is unrelated to performance. Our study therefore suggests that cross-sectoral partnership does deliver, but that the prospects of public service improvement may depend on the sectoral choice that organizations make.},

  abstract = {Over the past century, the size and reach of American state governments has increased dramatically, altering the balance of power across state capitols. Although state legislatures were historically privileged as ``firsts among equals,'' modern administrative reforms have transformed state governments from legislative-centric to executive-dominated systems. In many states, part-time citizen legislatures now operate alongside fully professionalized executives. We introduce a new measure capturing the relative professionalism of state legislative and executive branches, allowing us to explore the policy consequences of the rising imbalance of power across states governments. Drawing upon a large panel data set of proposed and adopted state regulations from 1990 through 2010, we demonstrate that the eroding policy expertise of state legislators has resulted in increased bureaucratic participation in the policy process, as amateur politicians rely more heavily on professionalized executive agencies to define problems and develop solutions. Our findings highlight intuitive, yet understudied, consequences of common institutional reforms and speak to recent and recurring debates about the separation of powers and public policymaking.},

Yet, the manner by which scholars select samples to conduct their analyses can have profound consequences on their ability both to draw valid causal inferences and to estimate accurate relationships. In this article, we review the basic threats to inference that are likely to emerge in the presence of non-random case selection, with specific attention to their manifestation in empirical public management research. The article first reviews the threats to causal inference presented by case selection, focusing on their implications for internal and external validity. We then summarize a standard set of solutions to address potential problems for empirical models caused by non-random case selection. As part of this discussion, we review recent articles published in this journal to illustrate the prevalence of selection issues in contemporary public management studies, and then illustrate several techniques that have been developed to overcome specific problems to show their utility for public management research.},

This paper explores a common case of collaborative governance\textemdash{}collaborative watershed councils (WCs)\textemdash{}and examines whether the actions of collaborative WCs improve water quality. Coupling longitudinal data concerning 1984 grants given to local WCs in the state of Oregon with water quality monitoring data sampled at 161 sites, this analysis tests whether there is a prima facie case that the actions of local collaborative institutions improve environmental outcomes. Along with presenting some of the first evidence about the impacts of collaborative governance that is based on an objective outcome metric, this paper also contrasts different council actions and considers how institutional capacity impacts council efforts. WC actions are shown to be associated with improved water quality, but the magnitude of improvement is dependent on council attributes and the type of project for which funds are allocated. This paper also makes a methodological contribution by demonstrating the use of hierarchical Bayesian modeling to account for spatial and temporal dependencies present in observational data.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the imminent expansion of Medicaid coverage for low-income adults, the effects of expanding coverage are unclear. The 2008 Medicaid expansion in Oregon based on lottery drawings from a waiting list provided an opportunity to evaluate these effects.
Methods Approximately 2 years after the lottery, we obtained data from 6387 adults who were randomly selected to be able to apply for Medicaid coverage and 5842 adults who were not selected. Measures included blood-pressure, cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin levels; screening for depression; medication inventories; and self-reported diagnoses, health status, health care utilization, and out-of-pocket spending for such services. We used the random assignment in the lottery to calculate the effect of Medicaid coverage.
Results We found no significant effect of Medicaid coverage on the prevalence or diagnosis of hypertension or high cholesterol levels or on the use of medication for these conditions. Medicaid coverage significantly increased the probability of a diagnosis of diabetes and the use of diabetes medication, but we observed no significant effect on average glycated hemoglobin levels or on the percentage of participants with levels of 6.5\% or higher. Medicaid coverage decreased the probability of a positive screening for depression (-9.15 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, -16.70 to -1.60; P\,=\,0.02), increased the use of many preventive services, and nearly eliminated catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenditures.

Such measures can be prone to common source bias whereby spurious results are highly likely. This article uses measurement theory to show why common source bias can be a problem and then introduces an empirical test for bias based on a data set that includes both perceptual measures of performance and archival measures. The empirical test shows that spurious results are not only common but that they might include as many as 50\% of all statistical tests. The article further examines the specific types of questions and measures most likely to generate measurement bias and provides guidelines for scholars conducting research on public organization performance.},

A federally funded state revolving fund (SRF) program combines features of a categorical matching grant to states and a subsidized loan program to localities, both of which should lower the effective price of infrastructure investment and therefore promote higher levels of infrastructure investment. However, little evidence exists to date on whether these programs stimulate new subnational spending or instead displace spending that would have occurred otherwise. We evaluate the stimulus effects of SRFs by examining the two largest such programs, the Clean Water and the Drinking Water SRF Programs. Analyzing 17 years of state-level panel data, we find evidence that the flow of federal funds to states under the SRF programs stimulates new local investment in wastewater infrastructure, but not in drinking water infrastructure. In discussing several possible explanations for these divergent results, we argue for further research that emphasizes the intergovernmental features of this financing tool.},

This suggests that the public has an interest in helping families to overcome their problems in general and to report domestic violence in particular.

  abstract = {A broad range of procedural mechanisms designed to promote public involvement in regulatory decision making have been instituted at all levels of government. Depending upon the literature one consults, one could conclude that these procedures (1) enhance regulatory stringency by fostering access by previously underrepresented groups, (2) reduce regulatory stringency by institutionalizing access by regulated industries, (3) could either increase or decrease stringency depending on the relative strength of organized interests in the agency's external environment, or (4) have no effect. This study investigates whether mechanisms designed to promote public involvement in administrative rulemaking affect the stringency of US state environmental regulation. The results suggest that requirements to provide public notice of agency rulemaking do not have a significant effect on the regulatory compliance costs imposed on industry, but mechanisms that provide direct access to rulemaking processes serve to decrease these costs. This effect is evident for access both to the agencies promulgating environmental regulations and to external entities reviewing these regulations. For promulgating agencies, the effect does not appear to be conditional on the relative power of societal interests. The results provide some evidence, however, that political officials respond to the strength of environmental and industry groups when reviewing agency regulations.},

We consider three types of spending: state appropriations to public universities as well as need- and non-need-based aid awarded to in-state students. We find that neither type of aid is responsive to the marginal cost, or tax price, faced by the median voter. However, the median voter's price elasticity of demand for state appropriations is statistically significant and negative. We find that the median voter's tax price is substantially reduced by the presence of prominent mining and tourism industries and by the nonresident ownership of capital. Thus, these tax-exporting capacities exert upward pressure on voter demand for state appropriations to public universities. C 2014 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

  abstract = {Administrative structure can shape bureaucratic process, performance, and responsiveness and is a particularly important consideration when new bureaucratic functions and programs are being established. However, the factors that influence the assignment of these functions to specific government agencies or departments are understudied, particularly at the local level. The absence of empirical evidence regarding bureaucratic assignment in local government limits understanding of institutional design and the organizational choices available, particularly as they relate to specific policy areas. As an initial step in developing a theory of agency assignment at the local level, we examine the placement of sustainability programs in 401 US cities and assess explanations for assignment based on policy scope, interest group support, governmental capacity, policy characteristics, and institutional structures that shape the incentives of local decision makers. Although it is not a traditional function of local government, sustainability is becoming an increasingly common objective. Because of its newness and cross-cutting nature, local policy makers have an array of institutional units to which they can assign the primary responsibility for sustainability. We focus on two dimensions of assignment of bureaucratic responsibility: whether the locus of responsibility lies within the executive or a line department and whether there is a specialized unit within the city government that is explicitly responsible for sustainability. The scope and maturity of cities' sustainability policies and the structure of local representation (i.e., whether council representatives are elected by district, at-large, or via a mixed system) have the greatest influence on shaping administrative placement. The latter suggests potential distributive outcomes from local sustainability efforts.},

  title = {Environmentally {{Efficient Well}}-{{Being}}: {{Rethinking Sustainability}} as the {{Relationship}} between {{Human Well}}-Being and {{Environmental Impacts}}},
  volume = {16},
  abstract = {The question of how to measure sustainability remains vexing. We approach the problem by noting that most theories of environmental impact assume that exploitation of the environment provides benefits to human well-being. However, this assumption has not been subject to much empirical discipline. We propose a model of Efficient Well-Being (EWEB) inspired by the Stochastic Frontier Production Models commonly used in economics. EWEB assesses a nation-state's efficiency in enhancing human well-being through the use of economic, natural and human resources. This approach shifts attention from the elusive question of whether a nation is sustainable to the more tractable question of how efficient a nation is in producing human well-being. We model human well-being as a function of physical, natural and human capital. In a preliminary test of this approach here we operationalize human well-being as life expectancy, flows of physical capital as gross domestic product per capita, flows of natural capital as the ecological footprint, and human capital as education. Using data from 135 nations, we find that controlling for physical and human capital, exploitation of the environment has no net effect on well-being. This suggests that improvements in well-being may be attainable without adverse effects on the environment. We also find that many nations could substantially improve their efficiency in using human and natural resources to generate well-being.},

  volume = {16},
  abstract = {A core question of sustainability science asks how and why human agents learn to deal effectively with complex problems. ``Learning'' refers to the process by which actors assimilate information and update their cognitions and behavior accordingly. Successful learning plays a vital role in our ability to achieve sustainability, and yet this process is poorly understood. Commonly-employed perspectives on learning tend to differentiate along two dimensions: the mechanism of learning (social versus individual learning) and the properties of the information being learned (empirical versus normative knowledge). This yields four ideal types of learning that correspond to a central challenge of learning for sustainability. An integrated framework that transcends all of these perspectives is needed. Such a framework is proposed here, and includes four essential features: the structure of internal belief systems, the role of social networks in shaping knowledge, the role of knowledge in shaping networks, and the role of individual experience in the learning process. This framework is introduced as a prolegomenon (a preface to more detailed and exhaustive theoretical development) to facilitate the development of better theories and empiricallytestable models of learning for sustainability.},

The data reveal that city managers earn policy-making leadership at the expense of their administrative authority.

Drawing on insights from Williams' Lifestyle Model of Metropolitan Politics and Frederickson's theory of administrative conjunctions, this paper uses network analytic methods to examine the structure of ILA networks, and to assess the impact of governing officials' interpersonal networks on the probability of ILAs forming between cities. Forty-four local governments in the Detroit metropolitan area provide the context for this study. Our findings show that these municipalities cooperate more extensively for system maintenance functions, such as transportation infrastructure and public works. More importantly, we find that any given cluster of municipalities has an increased probability of cooperating through ILAs when their senior administrators participate in the same local professional associations. The same effects hold true for elected executives' networking with counterparts, and for some functions, these electoral conjunctions serve as even stronger predictors of ILA usage than administrator's networks.},

Many previous empirical evidences suggest that fragmented governments are able to collaborate to share information even in the highly competitive economic development arena.This situation makes local officials in metro areas confront inevitable trade-offs between the potential benefits of interdependent policy action and uncertainties around selective incentives of participating governments. Especially, elected officials' aversion to risk and short time horizons make them sensitive to possibilities of being misled by wrong or irrelevant information.The authors contend that elected officials seek partners embedded in a structure of relationships that can reduce the political risks of collaboration as well as provide information, commitment that is necessary to overcome the barriers to collective action.

Their determinants, in turn, could point to how agency effectiveness might be enhanced. This article examines these perceptions and their possible determinants for the partnerships between the state of Georgia's Department of Transportation and the state's local governments. Drawing from prior research on citizen satisfaction with local governments, the article proposes a preliminary theory of local government partner perceptions of state agency performance, including several principal dimensions of those perceptions- customer, partner, and overseer or principal- and hypotheses on possible determinants of those perceptions. The relevance of the dimensions and the hypotheses are then tested using data from two surveys of local government officials in Georgia. A concluding section offers speculations on the meaning of these findings for thinking about public service collaborations.},

Of particular concern to scholars has been the rise of a hidden government that is not highly accountable through regular democratic processes. This article looks specifically at one form of special purpose government, known as a 'public authority,' and amends the conventional explanation that local governments principally create public authorities to address public finance concerns. First, I argue that full 'service public authorities,' which administer and make policy about a particular service arena, raise different concerns about democratic accountability from a 'conduit authority' and are a nonparsimonious solution to a public finance problem. Second, drawing on an archival survey of the institutional choices of county governments in dealing with solid waste policymaking in New York State, I find that while public finance is a driver in the choice to create a service public authority, equally, if not more important, are the needs of local government to resolve a policy problem in a politically competitive environment.},

Three cases from Chicago are examined in which the intergovernmental triad arrangement was utilized in attempts to reach development goals: the city's attempt to host the 1992 World's Fair, the construction of a new stadium for the Chicago White Sox, and Navy Pier's redevelopment. Using archival and interview data, the article traces events involving local and state governments that lead to the creation of special-purpose authorities to manage development projects.

Hypotheses are tested using pooled cross-sectional time-series data on 100 large U.S. cities in 1970, 1980, and 1990. Contrary to expectations, Black violent crime arrest rates are curvilinearly negatively associated with larger percentages of Black residents. As predicted, the relationship between the percentage of Black residents and Black violent crime arrest rates is conditional on city political system characteristics (elected mayors, district council elections, and partisan ballots), the race of the mayor, and the percentage of city council members who are Black.},

  abstract = {Across the United States homeless persons, prostitutes, and drug and alcohol users are subject to policies that severely limit their freedom of movement. These new policies create spatial exclusion zones that deny these groups the right to inhabit or traverse large areas of their cities, particularly in the downtown cores, where treatment centers, shelters, food banks, soup kitchens, government services, and other social services are typically concentrated. In this paper, I examine these new spatial exclusionary policies (with a focus on Washington State's policies), present a brief historical account of socio-spatial practices, contextualize the current spatial laws, and end with the implications of current exclusionary laws for social work practice, policy, and research.},

  abstract = {The development of affordable housing often involves a contentious siting process. Proposed housing developments frequently trigger concern among neighbors and community groups about potential negative impacts on neighborhood quality of life and property values. Advocates, developers, and researchers have long suspected that these concerns stem in part from racial or class prejudice. Yet, to date, empirical evidence supporting these assumptions is lacking. This study seeks to examine roles that perceptions of race and class play in shaping opinions that underlie public opposition to affordable housing. This study applies a public opinion survey to determine the extent to which stereotypes and perceptions of the poor and minorities relate to attitudes toward affordable housing. The results demonstrate that such perceptions are particularly strong determinants of negative attitudes about affordable housing. These findings provide advocates, planners, developers, and researchers with a more accurate portrayal of affordable housing opposition, thereby allowing the response to be shaped in a more appropriate manner.},

As a practice, economic development is an essential component of local policy and governing and a perceived driver of success and vitality for cities and regions alike. The notable distinction between practice and theory may explain the lack of scholarly consensus and the ambiguity in effectiveness of the practice of development. Using a three-tiered approach, we undertake a comparative analysis of the way in which practitioners and scholars undertake economic development. Through a study of Economic Development Quarterly journal keywords and a review of nine cities' economic development initiatives, we assess the most frequent topics and initiatives within the discipline. Using the International Economic Development Council best practice awards, we look at what is generally viewed as ``successful.'' We conclude with an assessment of the general development landscape, considering implications to our findings.},

Past research suggests that governments are often motivated to act because of the possible co-benefits, such as cost savings , associated with sustainability Many sustainability programs target inhouse city operations, however, thus ensuring that co-benefits accrue to local government while not imposing regulations on businesses or residents. Co-benefits might be less likely to drive decisionmaking when sustainability initiatives are directed to the larger community. In this article, we examine why some cities actively pursue the more difficult prospect of communitywide sustainability policy We merge secondary data with original data from a survey of local governments to explore three broad theoretical influences on decisionmaking: (1) interest group pressure, (2) problem severity or need, and (3) network strength. Our results suggest that, regardless of the institutional structure within a city, participation in some interlocal networks promotes communitywide sustainability initiatives.},

Using the Social Capital Benchmark Survey cities\textemdash{}10 of which have extensive sustainability programs, 5 of which have modest programs, and 12 of which have virtually no sustainability programs at all\textemdash{}as the source of comparison, this research finds that cities that are most committed to pursuing sustainability policies do tend to be more participatory places with respect to signing petitions, participating in demonstrations, belonging to local reform groups, and joining neighborhood associations, even controlling for personal income and other factors.},

We conceptualize the physical and social dimensions of the ``good'' neighborhood environment and develop an approach to operationalization that uses publicly available data. Our findings indicate that for the most part, Portland has been successful in creating neighborhoods at several economic scales that feature not only the connectivity, accessibility, mixed land use, and access to public transit that characterize ``good'' neighborhoods from a physical perspective, but also a ``good'' social environment indicative of strong ties and collective efficacy. However, there are signs that in the process, Portland may be creating poverty areas that lack connectivity, accessibility, and access to public transit and a mix of destinations.},

  abstract = {Political parties are often argued to be the central organizing force in American politics. Yet, most governments in the United States\textemdash{}nearly all at the local level\textemdash{}are formally nonpartisan. How is politics organized in these contexts? Is it always chaotic and factional, as existing evidence predicts, or can it ever resemble the type of highly-organized, electorally-accountable legislative environment that scholars typically associate with parties? In this paper, I document an empirical context\textemdash{}the city and county of San Francisco\textemdash{}where existing theory about nonpartisan government predicts poorly. Drawing on nearly 50 years of roll call votes, along with data on both newspaper coverage and the preferences of local voters, I show that legislative behavior in San Francisco is organized around two longstanding, party-like coalitions\textemdash{}one moderate, the other progressive\textemdash{}and that the electoral connection remains intact despite the lack of formal parties. Importantly, while this type of highly-structured, progressiveoriented political system is rare for nonpartisan governments, I show that it is unlikely to be unique, and that other nonpartisan municipalities across the country exhibit similar behavior. My findings highlight the value of extending studies of legislative institutions to the local level and provide strong evidence that representation is possible even in the absence of partisan elections.},

This research challenges previous studies arguing that their findings are the function of narrow definitions, a neglect of the political process, unrealistic assumptions about citizen preferences, and failure to consider the nature of bureaucratic discretion. Using empirical evidence from 140 large urban school districts, this study finds that politics is the major means available to minorities to
 influence policy implementation. Political action can counter the perceived social-class biases of urban bureaucracies.},

Using a modified shift-share technique with merged trade and industrial data at the three-digit level, the authors show that cities do indeed range widely in their relative comparative advantages. Furthermore, cities within a single state often have quite different stakes in heightened trade activity; some are better positioned to export, whereas others have more to gain from import protection or policies to strengthen domestic markets. Possessing a port no longer assures a metropolitan area a superior advantage in trade. The authors conclude that cities should study and fashion their own trade policies uniquely to match their existing and future capabilities.},

In the course of this project the public sector acted in ways that exemplify the entrepreneurial approach to downtown redevelopment. However, rather than simply taking on an entrepreneurial role, the city's efforts are better described by the term municipal capitalism. No longer content to simply stand by after providing some resources at the outset, the public sector is now the lead player throughout the entirety of the redevelopment process, an actor as focused upon the return on investment from the project as the private sector. This article concludes with a discussion of the emerging role of the public sector as a capitalistic actor, and explores the consequences of this emergence.},

This article provides insight by examining the adoption of sub-national climate change mitigation initiatives in the United States. Drawing from literature on policy innovation, a multilevel model is developed to examine the factors influencing over 900 U.S. cities to eschew free-rider tendencies and formally commit to greenhouse gas reduction. Multilevel analysis recognizes the nested structure of cities within states and accounts for the shared economic, political, and policy environments experienced by cities within the same state. The level of initiative state governments have taken toward climate protection varies considerably, and the influence of different state policies on related local decisions is empirically examined. Results are consistent with hypotheses derived from the innovation literature and suggest local-level characteristics are the dominant drivers of cities' decisions to commit to climate protection.},

In general, organized interests are more effective in mayoral as opposed to city manager forms of governments.

Furthermore, even among suburbanites, support is not uniform: African-Americans, lower income residents, and those with stronger ties to the city are all less supportive of slow-growth measures.},

Drawing on extensive survey data, including much that is original, two experts in public opinion and political behavior find that many citizens are remarkably informed about the details of politics, while equally large numbers are nearly ignorant of political facts. And despite dramatic changes in American society and politics, citizens appear no more or less informed today than half a century ago.Michael X. Delli Carpini and Scott Keeter demonstrate that informed persons are more likely to participate, better able to discern their own interests, and more likely to advocate those interests through political actions. Who, then, is politically informed? The authors provide compelling evidence that whites, men, and older, financially secure citizens have substantially more knowledge about national politics than do blacks, women, young adults, and financially less- well-off citizens. Thus citizens who are most disadvantaged socially and economically are least able to redress their grievances politically. Yet the authors believe that a broader and more equitably informed populace is possible. The challenge to America, they conclude, lies in providing an environment in which the benefits of being informed are clearer, the tools for gaining information more accessible, and the opportunities to learn about politics more frequent, timely, and equitable.},

  shorttitle = {Regression Models for Ordinal Responses},
  abstract = {Background. Epidemiologists are often interested in estimating the risk of several related diseases as well as adverse outcomes, which have a natural ordering of severity or certainty. While most investigators choose to model several dichotomous outcomes (such as very low birthweight versus normal and moderately low birthweight versus normal), this approach does not fully utilize the available information. Several statistical models for ordinal responses have been proposed, but have been underutilized. In this paper, we describe statistical methods for modelling ordinal response data, and illustrate the fit of these models to a large database from a perinatal health programme.
Methods. Models considered here include (1) the cumulative logit model, (2) continuation-ratio model, (3) constrained and unconstrained partial proportional odds models, (4) adjacent-category logit model, (5) polytomous logistic model, and (6) stereotype logistic model. We illustrate and compare the fit of these models on a perinatal database, to study the impact of midline episiotomy procedure on perineal lacerations during labour and delivery. Finally, we provide a discussion on graphical methods for the assessment of model assumptions and model constraints, and conclude with a discussion on the choice of an ordinal model. The primary focus in this paper is the formulation of ordinal models, interpretation of model parameters, and their implications for epidemiological research.
Conclusions. This paper presents a synthesized review of generalized linear regression models for analysing ordered responses. We recommend that the analyst performs (i) goodness-of-fit tests and an analysis of residuals, (ii) sensitivity analysis by fitting and comparing different models, and (iii) by graphically examining the model assumptions.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that there may be disadvantages in the use of the chi-square-like goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model proposed by Hosmer and Lemeshow that use fixed groups of the estimated probabilities. A particular concern with these grouping strategies based on estimated probabilities, fitted values, is that groups may contain subjects with widely different values of the covariates. It is possible to demonstrate situations where one set of fixed groups shows the model fits while the test rejects fit using a different set of fixed groups. We compare the performance by simulation of these tests to tests based on smoothed residuals proposed by le Cessie and Van Houwelingen and Royston, a score test for an extended logistic regression model proposed by Stukel, the Pearson chi-square and the unweighted residual sum-of- squares. These simulations demonstrate that all but one of Royston's tests have the correct size. An examination of the performance of the tests when the correct model has a quadratic term but a model containing only the linear term has been fit shows that the Pearson chi-square, the unweighted sum-ofsquares, the Hosmer\textemdash{}Lemeshow decile of risk, the smoothed residual sum-of-squares and Stukel's score test, have power exceeding 50 per cent to detect moderate departures from linearity when the sample size is 100 and have power over 90 per cent for these same alternatives for samples of size 500. All tests had no power when the correct model had an interaction between a dichotomous and continuous covariate but only the continuous covariate model was fit. Power to detect an incorrectly specified link was poor for samples of size 100. For samples of size 500 Stukel's score test had the best power but it only exceeded 50 per cent to detect an asymmetric link function. The power of the unweighted sum-of-squares test to detect an incorrectly specified link function was slightly less than Stukel's score test. We illustrate the tests within the context of a model for factors associated with low birth weight. 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. Stat. Med., Vol. 16, 965\textemdash{}980 (1997).},

These linear models are shown to be multivariate extensions of generalized linear models. Extensions to non-linear models are discussed and it is shown that even here the method of iteratively reweighted least squares converges to the maximum likelihood estimate, a property which greatly simplifies the necessary computation.

Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6 \textendash{}7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable.},

Research on other online political communication\textemdash{}especially candidate websites, blogs, and social media\textemdash{}tends to conclude that these communications are aimed primarily at turning existing supporters into campaign donors, activists, and volunteers. Is a similar communication strategy found in online display ads\textemdash{}those ads placed adjacent to website content? In one of the first systematic analyses of the nature, content, and targets of online display advertising, we examined 840 unique online display ads from the 2012 presidential campaign. We show that the policy content, ad location, and interactive elements of the ads varied based on the audience, with persuasive appeals aimed at undecided or persuadable voters and engagement appeals aimed at existing supporters. Comparing ad content across candidates also found that each side focused on those issues for which the candidate had a strategic advantage. As a consequence, and in contrast to the conclusions of previous research that examines television advertising, we found minimal issue engagement in online advertising.},

  abstract = {This essay discusses the multiple streams (MS) model of agenda-setting in the policy process and seeks to determine its explanatory utility for the European Union. Developed in relation to the federal government in the United States, the framework has hitherto been limitedly applied to the EU level. The present paper aims to contribute towards filling this gap in the literature by investigating the rise of a particular policy sector \textendash{} vocational education and training (VET) - on the EU's 2000 Lisbon Agenda. The investigation focuses on identifying the five elements of the model and on comparing the findings with other policy analysis tools in order to assess its suitability under the circumstances. It concludes that that the MS approach can indeed be useful for understanding the emergence of some policy areas in the Union (like VET), but it does not have explanatory value for EU policy-making in general.},

Despite a large number of empirical studies available to date, the relative importance of various determinants remains obscure because of difficulties of statistical identification. We present an experimental setting to study the diffusion of policy innovations in the laboratory. Our approach discriminates between experimentation, experience, and emulation as determinants of policy adoption. The policy innovation we study is an internalization tax to mitigate a local market externality. Our results demonstrate the importance of information about innovations in other states in the diffusion of policy innovations.},

  abstract = {Recent urban unrest has rekindled interest in the impacts of immigration on established U.S. communities. Yet little is known about the ways in which newcomers and established residents interact. Popular journalists emphasize only incidents of conflict and turmoil. This article examines the current portrayal of conflicts between immigrants and established residents. Immigrants and established residents live in social worlds divided institutionally and residentially. Although their separation maintains a degree of order, it creates pressures on those occasions when newcomers and established residents interact, including interactions in workplaces, stores, schools, and parks. The article also explores how both groups are working together to face common problems after two decades of profound economic restructuring. New demands on immigration and community policies must mobilize the voluntary sector to generate new resources and to articulate the values derived from their diverse communities. Voluntary organizations face challenges to adjust their established practices and to redefine their membership. These efforts are fundamental for recrafting the common good.},

The first focuses on information processing and punctuated equilibrium processes. The second addresses the attempts by scholars to move beyond subsystems as a unit of analysis. The third addresses the role of the bureaucracy in agenda setting, particularly during crises. The final section of the essay concludes by discussing future directions for research.},

However, low-salience policies that do not benefit from a groundswell of public opinion also spread across jurisdictions in patterns that appear similar to those of other, more well-known policy ideas. This research is an investigation of the mechanisms that propagate low-salience policies. I analyze the adoption of the U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy Efficient Design standard across 119 U.S. cities from 2000 to 2008. The investigation indicates that a knowledge broker, in this case the USGBC, occupies critical roles in linking a low-salience policy to a broader set of widely held societal values, developing a common policy vocabulary, providing a base policy that jurisdictions may freely adapt, and creating a diffusion infrastructure by acting as a communication hub for existing and interested jurisdictions to discuss innovations and progress.},

long time, but little systematic evidence has been produced so far. This article improves our understanding of this elusive argument by distinguishing between the policy and political consequences of reforms and by emphasizing the conditional nature of learning processes. Using a directed dyadic approach and multilevel methods, the analysis of unemployment benefits retrenchment in OECD countries demonstrates that policy makers learn selectively from the experience of others.
Right governments tend to be more sensitive to information on the electoral consequences of reforms, while left governments are more likely to be influenced by their policy effects.},

This paper argues that these varied findings stem from an implicit model of contextual influence that fails to account for the indirect effect of aggregate social contexts. A model of contextual influence is outlined which implies that the neighborhood partisan context moderates the effect of political disagreement in social networks on campaign participation. The evidence shows that network disagreement demobilizes people who are the political minority in their neighborhood, but has no influence on people in the majority. When viewed together, these findings indicate that a person's relationship to the broader political environment sets distinctive network processes in motion.},

  abstract = {This study examines how interpersonal recruitment affects participation in demanding forms of political activity. Previous studies have argued that interpersonal recruitment causally affects participation. However, recruitment attempts are selectively targeted toward people with high participation potential. This implies that interpersonal recruitment may work simply because recruiters ask the people who would participate anyway. Using propensity score matching, I show that interpersonal recruitment has larger effects on non-electoral forms of participation than electoral ones such as campaign volunteer activity. I find little evidence that personal contact increases campaign donation. I also demonstrate that the effect of recruitment is not constant across individuals but varies by the propensity of being a recruitment target. Ironically, people who have less chance of receiving requests are more likely to be affected. I discuss the implications of these findings for declining and increasingly unequal political participation.},

The first two theories have been well articulated in the literature; the third has not. We find no evidence of a decline in mobilizing activity, nor do we find that mobilizing techniques have become less effective.

An experiment examining the influence of negative political advertising on individuals' voting decisions indicated that the effects and effectiveness of such advertising depend, at least in part, on the situational involvement of the participants and the credibility of the candidate. As would be expected, participants' intent to vote for a candidate who uses negative political advertising is higher for a high-credibility candidate than for a low-credibility candidate. This is true regardless of their level of situational political involvement. However, highly involved participants do experience greater cynicism when a highcredibility candidate uses negative political advertising rather than when a low-credibility candidate uses such advertising.

I examine how campaigns do this by studying the content of issues appeals in television advertisements from U.S. House and Senate candidates. The use of issue frames is partisan. The two parties develop their own distinct rhetorical strategies on particular issues, showing that each party owns particular issue frames. In addition, campaign messages are sensitive to the partisanship of voters. Campaigns are more likely to use conservative frames in Republican-leaning districts and liberal frames in Democratic-leaning districts. Models of campaign strategy should incorporate not just what issues are discussed, but also the rhetorical choices campaigns make to address these issues.},

We hypothesize that more strongly racialized framings that highlight Obama's identity and connection with African Americans would push White voters toward more unfavorable evaluations of the candidate in comparison with deracialized framings. In addition, we argue that party identification has an important moderating influence on the relationship between the racialized treatment and respondents' evaluations of Obama.},

Through qualitative interviews, I examine the motivation factors for key players in the revitalization of Scranton's downtown, such as business owners, city and nonprofit administrators, and cultural leaders. Revitalizers are heavily influenced by Richard Florida's creative class theory in that they strongly believe that promoting arts and culture and creating a consumer-based downtown is imperative for urban renewal. However, revitalizers are also motivated because Scranton has a high level of social capital, especially in terms of bonding capital. Strong social ties (including community, family, and institutional) assist revitalizers in their creative endeavors. This study indicates that small cities attempting to achieve economic and population stability should focus on their strengths: city livability and the thick social ties that maintain communities.},

We find that highly creative metropolitan areas are as likely to suffer an economic decline that is as severe as that of their less creative peers. Moreover, key creative measures, such as immigrant populations, are negatively related to economic health.},

Since 1994 however, living wage ordinances have emerged as an alternative response to labor market polarization in urban areas. However, these laws raise labor costs for employers and may thus reduce economic growth. This article advances the empirical literature on living wage impacts through the use of a novel data set\textemdash{}the National Establishment Time Series\textemdash{}to track employment and establishment growth at the city level among directly affected employers (e.g., government contractors), as well as other establishments that may be indirectly signaled by a change in the local political environment. Using panel regression models that account for structural differences between living wage and non\textendash{}living wage cities, this article finds that living wage laws have no significant impact on employment or establishment growth. Additionally, this article finds no evidence that living wage laws ``signal'' businesses about a potentially harmful change in the local business climate.},

The central focus of this article is to explore the factors that contribute to managerial innovation in municipal governments in Wisconsin, as perceived by council members in their respective communities. Using multiple regression procedures we determine that managerial leadership and policy boardadministrative relations explain a significant amount of variation for innovations dealing with privatization, customer service, and strategic planning.

It would be useful to analyze the differences in outcomes associated with different structures, but two factors stand in the way. First, there is no agreement about how to classify city governments. Second, many of the components used in existing classifications are inaccurately reported or missing in survey data. In this research note, a new classification system based on three easily determined components is developed and used to measure the current distribution of forms and variations in an expanded data set that includes almost all cities over 10,000 in population.},

High levels of conflict or low levels of cooperation can hinder the decision-making process. However, there are few attempts to assess the causes of conflict and cooperation in the existing literature. This study uses an expanded typology of local government form and additional independent variables to determine what factors are likely to lead to conditions conducive to cooperation and lower perceived conflict in the local governance process. Data on government performance and indicators of perceived conflict and cooperation were collected from a national survey of municipal mayors, council members, and chief administrators in cities with populations of 50,000 to 250,000. Our results suggest that form of government and proportion of council members elected by district are two factors that significantly influence governance at the local level.},

Results confirm the influence of constituent political brand and point to white evangelicals as having an influence on a member's abortion position based on the size and homogeneity of their constituency.

On the other hand, the nature of the legislature is quite important here, with more professional legislatures actually encouraging executive leadership. A governor{\~O}s personal characteristics, political party, and a state{\~O}s economy also in{\ss}uence a governor{\~O}s legislative success.

The general puzzle that emerges from these debates, however, rests on the possibility that by electing representatives who are policy outsiders, minority interests would exert little influence in the policy decisions of median-dominated institutions. The authors present a model that shows how majority-minority districts can act to (1) increase the likelihood of electing minority representatives who are unique policy advocates and (2) concurrently increase the level of institutional status of descriptive representatives. The empirical analysis employs a novel data set of observations on political, sociodemographic, roll-call and institutional position, covering twenty U.S. states in the late 1990s and over 2,600 state legislative seats to show how majorityminority districts produce policy outsiders as well as institutional insiders.},

  abstract = {This article examines the influence of national government activity on the politics of embryonic stem cell research in the American states. Its analysis of bill introduction patterns between 1999 and 2008 suggests that President Bush's nationally televised address on stem cell research and the debate over the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act increased the probability that officials in a state would introduce stem-cell-related legislation in a given year. National activity also seemed to increase the number of bills that legislators introduced. These results illustrate how political forces can increase the salience of public policies and thereby serve as diffusion mechanisms during the agenda-setting process.},

  abstract = {In 1996, more than half of the states considered legislation banning same-sex marriages. This article examines these events as a geographic expansion of the scope of the conflict rather than as traditional state-centered policy innovation. I argue that the diffusion of same-sex marriage bans was determined by the organized efforts of advocacy coalitions and internal state characteristics rather than by regional diffusion or communication among policy experts. I use state-level data collected from activists, media accounts, and official sources to establish the organized efforts to ban same-sex marriage. I then develop and empirically test a model of policy diffusion to predict both state consideration and adoption of policies banning same-sex marriage. The findings suggest that the diffusion of these policies is best explained by the presence of an organized national campaign by conservative religious groups, the local resources of interest groups, and other internal state characteristics rather than by regional diffusion patterns. I also find that the influence of state characteristics may vary during the policymaking process.},

Although the activities of policy entrepreneurs have received close attention in several studies, the concept of policy entrepreneurship is yet to be broadly integrated within analyses of policy change. To facilitate more integration of the concept, we here show how policy entrepreneurship can be understood within more encompassing theorizations of policy change: incrementalism, policy streams, institutionalism, punctuated equilibrium, and advocacy coalitions. Recent applications of policy entrepreneurship as a key explanation of policy change are presented as models for future work. Room exists for further conceptual development and empirical testing concerning policy entrepreneurship. Such work could be undertaken in studies of contemporary and historical policy change.},

As a follow-up to Sales's (1973) study relating behavioral indicators of authoritarianism to levels of social threat, the present research analyzed archival data from the United States for high-threat (1978-1982) and low-threat (1983-1987) periods. Societal measures of most attitude and behavioral components of the authoritarian syndrome significantly decreased between the high-threat and the low-threat periods. These results support the threat-authoritarianism relationship
but also suggest a more complicated theoretical model that links perceived social conditions, arousal of authoritarian sentiments, dispositional authoritarianism, and the nature of political appeals\textemdash{}particularly those that engage authoritarian aggression.},

Arguing against perspectives suggesting that authoritarianism is the province of the ``unsophisticated,'' we hypothesize that the relationship between education and Republican partisanship should be stronger among educated Americans. Moreover, going beyond previous work on how education may moderate the political impact of psychological dispositions, we also argue that partisan signals pertinent to authoritarianism come more strongly from the right, producing a pattern in which the positive relationship between authoritarianism and preference for the Republican Party over independence is stronger among the educated but the negative relationship between authoritarianism and preference for the Democratic Party over independence is not stronger among the educated. Data from the 2004 and 2008 American National Election Studies indicate clear support for both hypotheses.},

The purpose of the present study was to examine several potential predictors of prejudice against international students: perceptions of international students as symbolic and realistic threats, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation. A simultaneous regression analysis that the authors based on 188 students at a Southwestern university revealed that perceptions of symbolic and realistic threats and social dominance orientation were each positive and significant predictors of prejudice. Mediation analyses suggested that the effects of right-wing authoritarianism on prejudice is fully mediated through perceived symbolic threat and partially mediated by realistic threat.},

However, threat was positively associated with the mean state percentage of people voting for Republican representatives in conservative states but not in liberal states, and the conventional threat\textendash{}authoritarianism link was entirely driven by the relation in conservative states. The author classified states with a composite measure ({$\alpha$} = .92) on the basis of state ideological identification, religious fundamentalism, composite policy liberalism, Republican Party elite ideology, and Democratic Party elite ideology. These results offer support to an interactive threat\textendash{}authoritarianism hypothesis derived from the authoritarian dynamic theory of K. Stenner (2005), which postulates that only authoritarian persons are activated to manifest authoritarian behavior in times of normative threat. Also, the author discusses potential alternative explanations on the basis of system justification, need for closure, and terror-management theories.},

I argue that Trump's rise is in part the result of authoritarian voters' response to his unvarnished, us-versus-them rhetoric. The failure of Republican Party insiders to coalesce behind one candidate opened the door for Trump. Authoritarian-driven partisan polarization (Hetherington and Weiler 2009), increasing fear of real and imagined threats, and terrorist incidents abroad and at home provided the fuel for Trump's campaign. And Trump's message and manner ignited that fuel, propelling him to the Republican nomination for president.},

Some theorizing, and a pilot study in the present research, suggests that the label ``homosexuals'' carries more deviance-related connotations than does the label ``gay men and lesbians.'' Given that right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) correlates positively with prejudice against groups stereotyped as deviant, it was hypothesized that RWA would predict greater prejudice against ``homosexuals'' than ``gay men and lesbians'' among heterosexual participants. Two studies supported this hypothesis and demonstrated that the effect was driven by both perceived threats to heterosexuals' values (i.e., symbolic threat; Study 1) and perceived fundamental differences between ``homosexuals'' and heterosexuals as social categories (i.e., psychological essentialism; Study 2). Implications for the factors that predict social categorization of and prejudice toward sexual minorities are discussed.},

  abstract = {Prior research theorizes that ambivalence makes opinions about an object unreliable in the sense of being haphazard, unpredictable, or variable. As such, ambivalence is a prominent explanation for seeming nonattitudes in opinion surveys. This study proposes an alternative account of the effects of ambivalence on attitudes. It posits that people who are ambivalent about an issue split the difference between their conflicting considerations by taking a position near the middle of the bipolar opinion scale, which reflects a moderate attitude. I show how the widelyused method of modeling the supposed variability of ambivalent opinions conflates variability and moderation. This problem is addressed by modeling variability and moderation of attitudes separately, without this confound. Using this strategy in analyses involving four datasets and three policy domains, the results show that ambivalence is associated with moderate, not variable, attitudes. Ambivalence does not increase the variability of opinions but, rather, moves them quite predictably toward the middle of the response scale. The results recast our understanding of the effects of ambivalence on political opinions and raise questions about the ability of ambivalence to explain nonattitudes in surveys.},

We proposed that ambivalence and certainty moderate one another's relationship with temporal attitude stability.

In three studies, we used two-stage designs in which attitudes were assessed twice with an interval ranging from one to twelve months between measurements. Across these longitudinal studies examining different attitude objects, greater certainty was associated with greater stability across different time points as ambivalence decreased, and greater ambivalence was associated with greater instability as attitude certainty increased. Notably, the results held across health-related, social, and real-world political topics.},

  abstract = {Despite the existing knowledge that urban rapid rail transit has many effects on surrounding areas, and despite some attempts to understand the links between transit and gentrification, there remain methodological gaps in the research. This study addresses the relationship between the implementation of urban rapid rail transit and gentrification, which is conceived of as an event. As such, an event analysis approach using `survival analysis' is adopted as the statistical analytical tool. It tests whether proximity to rail transit is related to the onset of gentrification in census tracts in Canada's largest cities. It is found that proximity to rail transit, and to other gentrifying census tracts, have a statistically significant effect on gentrification in two of the three cities analysed. By providing a methodological framework for the empirical analysis of the impact of urban rail transit on gentrification, this paper is a reference for both researchers and transportation planners.},

In a context where ethnic minorities are rarely openly blamed, we examined the lens through which the events were interpreted in the official discourses of the British Prime Minister. A thematic content analysis (Study 1) revealed that, without explicitly blaming ethnic minorities, the discourses built on antagonistic normative references opposing a virtuous majority to threatening minorities. Then, based on online survey data of selfdeclared Londoners (N 5 223) during the riots, we analyzed (Study 2) how agreement with the discourses related to individuals' ethnocentrism and their understanding of the causes underlying the events. Results of regression analyses showed how agreement with the discourses related to blaming ethnic diversity for the riots and to higher ethnocentrism, especially among individuals least likely to discriminate against minorities (i.e., low in social dominance orientation). Agreement with the discourses was also linked to reduced blame of authorities. To conclude, we discuss the mobilization potential of political discourses on ingroup virtue and outgroup threat.},

In particular, we draw on the literature in social psychology to explore the role of locus of control in promoting more ethnocentric and restrictive attitudes towards immigration. We conceptualize control at three levels: (1) perceptions of individual locus of control (i.e., feeling that one can control one's own circumstances), (2) perceptions of societal control (i.e., feeling that one's country has control over immigration), and (3) perceptions of an outgroup's locus of control (i.e., feeling that an outgroup's social circumstances are attributable to dispositional rather than external factors). Results show that all three measures of control are important predictors of negative attitudes toward immigrants: Those who feel in control (personally or as a society) are less hostile towards immigrants, while those who attribute negative outcomes to immigrants' predispositions are also more hostile. Results also suggest that measures of control are related to, but distinct from, both partisanship and racial prejudice.},

We argue that racial and political identities predispose individuals to believe certain attributional perspectives over others. We test several hypotheses using individual level survey data from two national surveys. Our findings suggest that racial and political identities strongly shape attributions, and these patterns have implications for public trust in government institutions and the ability of police to operate effectively.

  abstract = {Despite the increased emphasis on domestic politics in the study of international law, scholars remain divided about whether and how international law affects domestic institutions. Moreover, while public support is a core ingredient for sustainable, legitimate policies in a democracy, research at the individual level of analysis remains limited. Weighing in on these areas of study, we investigate the use of drone strikes for counterterrorism, a subject of considerable debate. Proponents in the government point to drones as both effective for disrupting terrorist networks and compatible with international law. Critics from groups such as international organizations (IOs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) respond that attacks create more terrorists than they kill and violate legal commitments. The central question we ask in this article is whether these international legal criticisms impact public support for drone strikes, the centerpiece of US counterterrorism policy, or whether individuals are more persuaded by effectiveness-based arguments. Employing a survey experiment of a nationally representative sample of the United States, we find IO and NGO criticisms can shape public attitudes even around an important national security issue like drone strikes, but are most influential when messages center on legal critiques rather than matters of effectiveness. Our findings speak to fundamental questions about the domestic politics of international legal commitments, the role of IOs and NGOs in shaping political debates, and the durability of US counterterrorism policy.},

If the cause is perceived as uncontrollable (biological or genetic in origin), positive affect and increased support for polices is anticipated. Our anal yses of data from two unique surveys of national adults corroborate these hypotheses, showing that positive feelings toward gays, support for gay civil rights, civil unions, and same-sex marriage are strongly determined by a genetic attribution for homosexuality. Attributions are in fact the strongest predictor of support.

Members of the public may lack information about the world around them, but they do not lack principles, and information need not only cascade from the top down. We present the results from five survey experiments where we show that cues from social peers are at least as strong as those from political elites. Our theory and results build on a growing number of findings that individuals are embedded in a social context that combines with their general orientations toward foreign policy in shaping responses toward the world around them. Thus, we suggest the public is perhaps better equipped for espousing judgments in foreign affairs than many of our top-down models claim.},

As a result, recent scholarship suggests that public opinion may be the strongest check against executive overreach. However, little is known about how the public assesses unilateral action. Through a series of five survey experiments embedded in nationally representative surveys, we examine the extent to which Americans evaluate unilateral action based on constitutional, partisan, and policy concerns. We find that Americans do not instinctively reject unilateral action as a threat to our system of checks and balances, but instead evaluate unilateral action in terms of whether it accords or conflicts with their partisan and policy preference priors. Our results suggest that the public constraint on presidential unilateral action is far from automatic. Rather, the strength and scope of this check are variable products of political contestation in the public sphere.},

  abstract = {Objective: Racism is related to policies preferences and behaviors that adversely affect blacks and appear related to a fear of blacks (e.g., increased policing, death penalty). This study examined whether racism is also related to gun ownership and opposition to gun controls in US whites.
Method: The most recent data from the American National Election Study, a large representative US sample, was used to test relationships between racism, gun ownership, and opposition to gun control in US whites. Explanatory variables known to be related to gun ownership and gun control opposition (i.e., age, gender, education, income, conservatism, antigovernment sentiment, southern vs. other states, political identification) were entered in logistic regression models, along with measures of racism, and the stereotype of blacks as violent. Outcome variables included; having a gun in the home, opposition to bans on handguns in the home, support for permits to carry concealed handguns.
Results: After accounting for all explanatory variables, logistic regressions found that for each 1 point increase in symbolic racism there was a 50\% increase in the odds of having a gun at home. After also accounting for having a gun in the home, there was still a 28\% increase in support for permits to carry concealed handguns, for each one point increase in symbolic racism. The relationship between symbolic racism and opposition to banning handguns in the home (OR1.27 CI 1.03,1.58) was reduced to non-significant after accounting for having a gun in the home (OR1.17 CI.94,1.46), which likely represents self-interest in retaining property (guns).
Conclusions: Symbolic racism was related to having a gun in the home and opposition to gun control policies in US whites. The findings help explain US whites' paradoxical attitudes towards gun ownership and gun control. Such attitudes may adversely influence US gun control policy debates and decisions.},

Transport problems are expected to worsen due to the fact that worldwide automobile ownership tripled between 1970 and 2000, and the movement of goods is projected to increase by 50\% by 2010. Similar trends can be seen in an even more dramatic way in Turkey. The Turkish transport network has not followed a planned growth strategy, due to political factors. There is no transportation master plan which aims to integrate the transport modes in order to provide a balanced, multimodal system. This study proposes a decision support system that guides transportation policy makers in their future strategic decisions and facilitates analysis of the possible consequences of a specific policy on changing the share of transportation modes for both passenger and freight transportation. For this purpose, based on the wide spectrum of critical issues encountered in the transportation sector, several scenarios have been built and analysed.},

  abstract = {Assessing the performance of public transit services has long been an important yet challenging issue for transportation agencies and researchers. Transit service performance measurement reflects a very first step towards an efficient and proactive management, where public transit agencies are increasingly pressured to provide high-quality services in spite of constrained resources. However, the performance evaluation of transit services is complicated by an array of quantitative measures available to assess the goals and the diversity in the goals themselves, which usually include improving operational efficiency and providing equitable access. While much previous work has examined public transit services for achieving optimal operational efficiency and/or access equity separately, the interplay of the two has rarely been investigated to date. This article proposes a new method for evaluating the overall performance of public transit services via a combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA), Geographic Information System (GIS), and multi-objective spatial optimization techniques. The new method is applied to assessing the performance of fixed route bus services operated by the Utah Transit Authorities (UTA) in the Wasatch Front, Utah. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively account for operational efficiency and access equity in an integrated framework, providing a more comprehensive assessment for transit service performance.},

One explanation for these findings is the short length of time which MTO families typically spent in lower-poverty neighborhoods; the positive effects of longer-term exposure to low-poverty neighborhoods appear more promising.},

  abstract = {Urban rail systems have been added to public transport systems, thereby changing distribution disparities in urban spatial accessibility. These disparities reflect both the ability of the public transport system to meet the needs of residents and the locational pros and cons of public service facilities. In this paper, integrated accessibility metrics are used to assess the disparities in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. This is achieved by dividing the urban space into a multilevel grid that can be easily combined with grid-based population data to facilitate accessibility modeling, calculation, and evaluation. Additionally, an acquisition method for more accurate travel time data in the multimodal public transportation network was developed on the basis of an Internet mapping service. This provides a realistic, multimodal, door-to-door modeling approach that avoids the requirement of building complex traffic networks through Geographic Information System (GIS) software and simplifies road network modeling efforts. The results show that this modeling method can be used to reflect the accessibility disparities in the Nanjing urban space objectively and accurately.},

  abstract = {Housing affordability is traditionally measured using the percentage of household income spent on housing. An important cost that is usually overlooked in measuring location affordability is the transportation or accessibility costs. In this paper, we present a modeling approach, driven by urban open data, to measure location affordability that incorporates both housing and transportation costs. We apply the developed model to assess housing affordability in Melbourne, Australia as a case study. Results suggest that neighbourhoods that appear to be affordable when only housing cost is considered are not necessarily affordable when transportation costs are taken into account. A negative correlation between housing affordability and transportation affordability is observed. We also identify the presence of a strong spatial clustering pattern in the affordability measure across the study area. A major methodological contribution of the paper is the inclusion of comprehensive private vehicle costs and public transportation expenses in the model that contributes to a more robust estimation and understanding of location affordability. The model also distinguishes between different trip purposes. Results suggest that plans and policies to improve housing affordability should be made in coordination with transportation infrastructure investment plans to ensure effective and equitable outcomes. Nevertheless, the focus of the paper is more on the measurement of affordability; rather than reviewing and recommending housing related policies.},

Such an effect is widely viewed as an economic benefit for property owners and is key to justifying the high cost of building rail transit infrastructure. In recent years, however, concerns have been raised about rail transit acting as a gentrification trigger and causing the affordability paradox. In this study, I evaluate whether rail transit in suburban Portland caused neighborhood gentrification and reduced home affordability through a longitudinal quasi-experimental design. I use the propensity score matching method to identify control neighborhoods for rail-transit-served neighborhoods. I then make pretest-posttest comparisons between rail-transitserved neighborhoods and their control neighborhoods at multiple observation points. In general, I did not find consistent evidence for rail-transit-induced gentrification in suburban Portland. I did not find evidence that rail transit reduced home affordability for tenants and home owners in rail transit-served neighborhoods either. I observed more changes in the neighborhoods served by the Eastside line (the oldest rail transit line in Portland) than their control neighborhoods in the past three decades: socially, they attracted older and less-educated population; physically, they experienced densification and faster increases of the share of rental units in their housing stock. Rail transit was more likely to be installed along low-income neighborhoods in suburban Portland, confirming the necessity of constructing appropriate control neighborhoods while evaluating the neighborhood and social effects of rail transit.},

In this study, a community opportunity index (COI) is computed for Columbus, Ohio, using a set of socioeconomic factors. An ordinary regression and GWR model are estimated to account for the global and local effects of land uses and capital investments respectively, while controlling for socio-demographical characteristics. The global results indicate that the community opportunity increases as the distance from the city center increases, while The Ohio State University (OSU) has higher positive spillover-effect on near communities than on distant ones. However, the local results appear a local spatially inverse relationship in the areas adjacent to the international airport (CMH), indicating the existence of negative externalities. With the advantage of visualizing spatial variations, the GWR results suggest that the most effective location for allocating future developments is in eastern Columbus, where shows a clustering of higher COI premiums of a percentage change in residential and commercial uses. A variety of spatial variations is found among different capital-investment effects. Therefore, local characteristics require consideration when allocating additional public facilities. Finally, the GWR results reveal the existence of spatial mismatch that socially disadvantaged groups (e.g. black population, other minorities, single-parent families, and zero-vehicle households) tend to reside in vulnerable communities. These local results provide a new perspective on land-use and transportation planning to help shape a fair community opportunity framework for the future.},

In New Jersey, however, there has been increased policy support for TOD. The question addressed here is how, if at all, TOD and TOD-proximate residents' perceptions of the benefits and shortcomings of TOD are perceived and addressed by professionals involved with TOD planning and development. A qualitative research approach was used, with focus groups with residents and structured interviews with professionals. A relatively well-fitting correspondence was found: There was broad agreement by residents and professionals on the value of transit and TOD for increased accessibility and walkability. Problems were identified with retail development and traffic problems; the latter expressed as a congestion problem by professionals but as a pedestrian safety problem by residents. This information provides useful insight for planners and developers seeking to deliver TOD designs that match the preferences of residents and potential residents, and for new avenues of research on how best to achieve this.},

The aim of this paper is to empirically demonstrate the importance of accounting for potential spatial dependence between observations in the specification of spatial interaction models. As a case study, we analyze travel flows on the public transport system in an urban region in the Netherlands. We develop five distinct spatial interaction models (SIMs) of increasing complexity, each encompassing a lower and upper level model. At the lower level, the attractiveness of neighborhoods for boarding and alighting is modeled based on spatial and transit supply characteristics. At the upper level, spatial interactions among zones are modeled taking into account competing origins, competing destinations as well as network characteristics. We systematically compare more traditional SIM formulations with a SIM that explicitly accounts for spatial and network autocorrelation. The results show a substantial difference between the former models and the latter, in terms of the estimated total marginal impacts of the different variables and the pattern of the error terms. The results of our study underscore that the failure to incorporate autocorrelation effects in travel models is likely to influence model outcomes, which in turn may have profound implications for the very design of public transport networks in cities and regions.},

Taking a community perspective, this study considers how individuals discuss their needs in relation to community conditions impacting personal transportation choices. We collected data through 14 community listening sessions, or modified focus groups, conducted in diverse communities across the greater San Francisco Bay Area (USA). The community context for the groups indicated three types of transportation orientation: (1) cardominant in which driving alone was the primary mode of travel, (2) mixed-mode in which driving alone as well as a variety of other transportation modes were used for travel, and (3) sustainable transportation-oriented in which alternatives to driving alone were primarily used. In all three types of communities, personal transportation choices related to physical and sociocultural conditions that allowed residents to meet different needs. Our findings suggest that considering how community-level conditions meet practical and psychological needs may offer ways to more effectively support individual-level sustainable transportation choices.},

We measure travel behavior in two ways: (1) using a multi-faceted traveler typology created using latent class analysis, and (2) by measuring the vehicle miles of travel among people in each of these traveler types. This dual approach allows us to distinguish between the built environment changes needed to encourage travel by modes other than driving, and those needed to reduce vehicle miles traveled among drivers. Using a multinomial logistic regression, we find that travel patterns are relatively stable along much of the urban-rural continuum, everything else equal. Driving was substantially lower only in ``Old Urban'' neighborhoods, where densities, job access, and transit service are dramatically higher than in all other neighborhood types. This finding implies that dramatic changes in the built environment\textemdash{}doubling or even tripling development density or transit service\textemdash{}may do little to get young people out of their cars when initial densities or transit services are low, as they are in most of the U.S. Conversely, reducing vehicle miles traveled among drivers appears to require more modest built form changes, a finding that offers some room for optimism among those concerned with auto dependence.},

To examine these hypotheses, this study applies gravity-type job accessibility indexes based on a study sample of 7077 observations in the Taipei Metropolitan Area, Taiwan, from the year 2009. The sample data are analyzed using linear and quantile regressions. The empirical evidence confirms the positive effect of job accessibility on apartment rents, and its variability depending on the transportation mode and rental level. The effect of job accessibility on apartment rent is significantly positive in the median or lower-rent-level sub-markets, but insignificantly negative in higher-rent-level sub-markets. Job accessibility by motorcycle and public transit has a higher positive influence on rent than accessibility by car. These findings provide new knowledge on the role of access to jobs in explaining apartment rents, and reveal a fresh policy direction on rental subsidy programs for lower-income workers living in cities.},

Each jurisdiction identifies transportation justice (or environmental justice) areas based on their own methodology, typically based on either average regional thresholds, graduated thresholds, or a more unique in-house index methodology. This research explores and evaluates existing methods and develops a rigorous and comprehensive method called the Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as factors based on demographics, socio-economics, and transportation/land use.

And yet, justice considerations have traditionally played only a marginal role in transportation decision-making, such as those regarding investment in a new infrastructure project. Considerations of justice stress the plight of disadvantaged populations and thus aim to further equality between groups and individuals, especially equality of opportunities and mobility. But how can such considerations be derived from theories of justice and fairness in ways that make them applicable to real-world situations? In this article we offer a new framework for incorporating justice considerations into decision-making association with transport service provision. Our analytic framework is based on the capabilities approach developed by Sen and Nussbaum. After explaining the essence of this approach, we show how transportation allocation criteria can be derived and then incorporated into de facto decision-making. Finally, we provide a real-world example of the implementation of this approach in the provision of transportation services. \& 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Metropolitan planning organizations typically undertake an analysis of regional transportation plan equity to comply with federal anti-discrimination law, most prominently Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In this critical review, we examine the law, regulatory guidance, academic research, and agency practice pertinent to equity analysis. We find that recommendations are extensive but generally lack specificity and are rarely enforceable. In the absence of detailed guidance, practice has become dominated by a single method that has foundations in the spatial analysis of environmental exposures and the neighborhood effects literature. We argue that this method is not appropriate for the analysis of transportation investment benefits, in part because target populations must be defined a priori based on demographic thresholds for areal units rather than on the basis of exposure. Further, it does not represent the travel behavior of Title VI-protected populations adequately, most notably people of color. Newer travel demand modeling paradigms are capable of sidestepping methodological problems, and legacy models can be adapted and improved. However, agencies generally have not shifted from traditional methods and planners do not view race as a variable relevant to travel behavior. By relying on an analytical technique that is not likely to reflect the travel behavior of people of color, planning agencies reduce the likelihood that racially disparate outcomes will be identified and mitigated. Meaningful transportation equity analyses must include an assessment of both current and near-term conditions and provide racially specific outcomes, while seeking to mitigate inequities through programming decisions.},

  abstract = {Urban transport policies are characterized by a wide range of impacts, and trade-offs and conflicts among these impacts. The task of integrating and reconciling these impacts poses challenges, because they are incommensurable, and they affect different groups differentially. Further, impacts such as those related to social equity are hard to define and measure. In this paper we address two inter-related questions: How is social equity conceptualized, operationalized, and prioritized relative to environmental and other objectives; and how might social equity be more effectively integrated in urban transportation plans in North America? We critically analyze how social equity is incorporated into transportation plans in 18 large North American metropolitan areas, in terms of the quality of the related objectives, how meaningfully their achievement is assessed through the choice of performance measures or indicators, and their prioritization relative to other objectives. We observe that social equity goals and objectives are in many cases not translated into clearly specified objectives, and appropriate measures for assessing their achievement in a meaningful, disaggregated manner are often lacking. At the same time, there are good examples of social equity objectives and measures in several plans. In general, there is a stronger focus on the local environment (and congestion reduction) than on social equity in the plans. We end the paper with a discussion related to considerations for generating objectives and measures for better integrating social equity into urban transportation plans.},

  abstract = {While equity has been an important consideration for transportation planning agencies in the U.S. following the passage of Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI specifically) and the subsequent Department of Transportation directives, there is little guidance on how to assess the distribution of benefits generated by transport investment programs. As a result, the distribution of these benefits has received relatively little attention in transportation planning, compared to transport-related burdens. Drawing on philosophies of social justice, we present an equity assessment of the distribution of accessibility in order to define the rate of ``access poverty'' among the population. We then apply this analysis to regional transportation plan scenarios from the San Francisco Bay Area, focusing on measures of differences between public transit and automobile access. The analysis shows that virtually all neighborhoods suffer from substantial gaps between car and public transport-based accessibility, but that the two proposed transportation investment programs reduce access poverty compared to the ``no project'' scenario. We also investigate how access and access poverty rates vary by demographic groups and map low-income communities within access impoverished areas, which could be the subject of further focused investments.},

  shorttitle = {Planning for Transportation Equity in Small Regions},
  abstract = {Regional transportation planning agencies seek to achieve multiple objectives simultaneously including consensus on key issues, compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and improvements in the congestion, air quality, and safety performance of the transportation system. Some performance areas lend themselves well to operationalization while others do not. One area that has received comparatively little study is the assessment of a plan's impacts on environmental justice and social equity. Although research on regional planning usually emphasizes larger metropolitan areas and agencies, these issues are especially relevant in smaller regions where planners lack the capacity for innovation and careful analysis. Further, the transit services on which disadvantaged populations depend are often lacking or non-existent in less-populated regions. Understanding how planners in these locations undertake social equity-related analyses and providing suggestions for improvement is thus an important endeavor. While prior work has assessed whether, and to what extent, equity objectives are included in plans, there are few detailed investigations of the key analytical choices that shape equity outcomes. This paper fills this important research gap, providing such an analysis of existing practice in a largely rural region in California, the San Joaquin Valley, as well as recommendations for future analyses aimed at improving the consistency between equity analyses and the real-world impacts of transportation plans.},

Since transport has an important role in distributing socio-economic benefits or losses created by different means or by transport itself, it has a crucial role in the discussion of social justice. This importance occurs from transport's different effects depending on the levels or the types of equity in the distribution: transport can help develop socially just societies or cause disparities between different or within same geographies. Therefore, for the system to be efficient, the distribution needs to be socially just. This paper provides a synthesis of social justice and transport literature in terms of equal rights and shares, freedom, capabilities, opportunities and choices by making use of contemporary approaches in the social justice theory and considering the varieties in different geographies, individuals and markets. Using the Capability Approach (CA), this paper first highlights the areas which need to be discussed in transport studies in terms of social justice, and second suggests a methodology which considers social justice norms in transport research by engaging the CA with existing methods.},

  abstract = {The conversion of Earth's land surface to urban uses is one of the most irreversible human impacts on the global biosphere. It drives the loss of farmland, affects local climate, fragments habitats, and threatens biodiversity. Here we present a meta-analysis of 326 studies that have used remotely sensed images to map urban land conversion. We report a worldwide observed increase in urban land area of 58,000 km2 from 1970 to 2000. India, China, and Africa have experienced the highest rates of urban land expansion, and the largest change in total urban extent has occurred in North America. Across all regions and for all three decades, urban land expansion rates are higher than or equal to urban population growth rates, suggesting that urban growth is becoming more expansive than compact. Annual growth in GDP per capita drives approximately half of the observed urban land expansion in China but only moderately affects urban expansion in India and Africa, where urban land expansion is driven more by urban population growth. In high income countries, rates of urban land expansion are slower and increasingly related to GDP growth. However, in North America, population growth contributes more to urban expansion than it does in Europe. Much of the observed variation in urban expansion was not captured by either population, GDP, or other variables in the model. This suggests that contemporary urban expansion is related to a variety of factors difficult to observe comprehensively at the global level, including international capital flows, the informal economy, land use policy, and generalized transport costs. Using the results from the global model, we develop forecasts for new urban land cover using SRES Scenarios. Our results show that by 2030, global urban land cover will increase between 430,000 km2 and 12,568,000 km2, with an estimate of 1,527,000 km2 more likely.},

  abstract = {This study assesses the impact of proximity to light rail transit stations on residential property values in Buffalo, New York, where light rail has been in service for 20 years, but population is declining and ridership is decreasing. Hedonic models are constructed of assessed value for residential properties within half a mile of 14 light rail stations and independent variables are included that describe property characteristics, neighbourhood characteristics and locational amenities. The model suggests that, for homes located in the study area, every foot closer to a light rail station increases average property values by \$2.31 (using geographical straight-line distance) and \$0.99 (using network distance). Consequently, a home located within one-quarter of a mile radius of a light rail station can earn a premium of \$1300\textendash{}3000, or 2\textendash{} 5 per cent of the city's median home value. Model results further suggest that three independent variables\textemdash{}the number of bathrooms, size of the parcel and location on the East side or West side of Buffalo\textemdash{}are more influential than rail proximity in predicting property values. Individual regression models for each of the light rail system's 14 stations suggest that effects are not felt evenly throughout the system. Proximity effects are positive in high-income station areas and negative in low-income station areas. An analysis of the actual walking distance to stations (along the street network) versus the perceived proximity to stations (measured by straight-line distance) reveals that the results are statistically more significant in the network distance than the straight-line distance model, but the effects are greater in the straight-line distance model, which suggests that apparent proximity to rail stations is an added locational advantage compared with physical walking distance to the station.},

Many view TOD as a key element in creating a less auto dependent and more sustainable transport system. Price premiums indicate a potential for a market-driven expansion of TOD inventory. A hedonic price model is estimated to isolate statistically the effect of TOD. This includes interaction terms between station distance and various measures of pedestrian orientation. The resulting model shows that station proximity has a significantly stronger impact when coupled with a pedestrian-oriented environment. Conversely, station area condominiums in more auto-oriented environments may sell at a discount. This indicates that TOD has a synergistic value greater than the sum of its parts. It also implies a healthy demand for more TOD housing in San Diego.},

We use a network distance measure and a local-polynomial-regression approach to identify the CCL impact zone with discontinuity in housing price gradient between a treatment zone and a control zone. We then estimate the spatial difference-in-differences models that account for spatial autocorrelation in housing price changes in the two zones ``before and after'' the opening of the CCL. We find that the opening of the CCL increases housing value in the treated neighborhoods located within the 600-metre network distance from the new CCL stations by approximately 8.6\%, relative to other properties in the untreated neighborhoods controlling for heterogeneities in housing attributes and local amenities, and spatial and temporal fixed effects. We find significant ``anticipation'' effects as early as 1 year prior to the opening of the CCL line, but the effects diminish closer to the actual opening date. The results imply that the inter-dependent spatial structure between the treated and the untreated neighborhoods, if neglected, may lead to over-estimation of the capitalization effects of the new transit lines on housing values.},

  abstract = {The policy choices of local governments are highly relevant today, but we know relatively little about how or when local governments choose to respond to a given issue and why this might vary between policy areas. A key variant for local governments is the proximity of policy issues: they are engaged in solving local, regional, and global problems. Using evidence from the United States on the policy issues of social inclusion, watershed management, and climate change, we demonstrate that the drivers of policy response vary with the proximity of the problem. When an issue is highly local, policy response is influenced by problem severity; when an issue is global, policy response is influenced by local political leanings; and when an issue is regional, policy response is driven by the actions of neighboring and state level governments. Local governments consider different factors and respond to different cues when engaging with different types of policy issues. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of sustainability policy adoption in local governments, and further our understanding of the domaincontingent nature of policy response in local governments and the structuring role of problem proximity.},

This paper focuses on analyzing the extent to which firms' siting decisions based on community privilege can explain this outcome. A unique feature of this analysis is that we include analysis of both unwanted land uses (disamenity firms) and desired land uses (amenity firms). The environmental justice analysis of amenities other than green spaces is rare, but amenities are crucial components of urban areas to which environmental justice studies must attend. We use an agent-based model to explore community outcomes when environmental disamenities choose locations based on low community privilege, and compare this with scenarios in which disamenities only seek to minimize the cost of land. We also assess differences in environmental justice outcomes when amenities choose locations in areas with high community privilege. While disamenities' focus on locating in areas with low community privilege indeed affects environmental equity, the effect of amenity location is also important, and there are powerful interaction effects. The importance of privilege-based location is found in these simulations regardless of which social group\textemdash{}majority or minority\textemdash{}is assumed to be the privileged group. This study suggests a limitation of EJ policies and models that focus on the politics of disamenity siting without considering the politics of amenity siting.},

Analyzing this phenomenon from a `policy mobility' perspective, this article traces the food desert's emergence in policy discourse, locating it within an entrepreneurial social policy para\- digm that privileges real estate development over direct economic relief. In the context of property-led anti-poverty efforts, the identification and mapping of food deserts cata\-lyzes a logic that leads to subsidy to grocery store development in low-income areas (or `fresh food financing'), while at the same time officials are cutting programs such as the Supple\- mental Nutrition Assistance Program ( food stamps), which directly supplements house\- hold food budgets. The article contributes to widening critical discussion of the food desert paradigm and the policy interventions with which it is associated. It calls on urban researchers and practitioners to reframe discussions of food access and nutrition around the shortage of basic income and a need for higher wage floors.},

  abstract = {Current UK housing policy favours high-density, mixed-use development on previously developed urban land. This ties in with a general policy to promote an `urban renaissance', largely because of its claimed advantages for sustainability. However, there has been little testing to date of sustainability impacts in practice. This is particularly true for the social equity aspect of sustainability, despite its acknowledged centrality to the concept. This paper outlines the development of a theory of social equity in relation to urban form and presents empirical research based on this to test the case of the so-called `compact city', that is, high-density, mixed-use urban form. The research involved a comparative investigation of a range of alleged social equity impacts in 25 medium-sized English cities of differing levels and types of compactness. The findings suggest that, in certain respects and with certain qualifications, the compact city has the potential to promote social equity. Likely benefits include reduced car dependency and lower levels of social segregation, while the main problem is likely to be a lack of affordable, decent-sized homes. Positive effects are emerging in response to re-urbanisation and development on derelict land, and the cities which most support equity appear to be those that have a large proportion of high-density housing and a large quantity of locally provided services and facilities.},

Energy efficiency strategies for the residential sector must, therefore, be multidimensional, fully synergised with housing policy, and incorporating the principles of equity, access and a balanced geographical development. This paper discusses a strategic policy framework, which was designed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) to address those important needs in international policy.

In times with falling housing prices, the mobility of home owning workers may be hampered by a lock-in effect of low or even negative housing equity. This paper explores the effect of housing equity on both the residential mobility and the commuting pattern of homeowners. We merge administrative registers for the Danish population and properties and get highly reliable micro data for our analysis. We find that low and negative housing equity substantially reduces residential mobility among homeowners. The negative effect of locked-in low equity families on labor market mobility may be mitigated by commuting. However, our results show that family heads in low or negative equity homes are not found to commute more than households with higher housing equity, but also that a considerable fraction of home owning family heads commute. The analysis of the joint decision of homeowners to commute or move shows that the option of moving, as an alternative to not moving and not commuting, is chosen by five to six percent of homeowners with low housing equity, while the option of not moving but commuting is chosen by 60\%.},

  abstract = {Public bus transit plays an important role in city transportation infrastructure. However, public bus transit is often difficult to use because of lack of real-time information about bus locations and delay time, which in the presence of operational delays and service alerts makes it difficult for riders to predict when buses will arrive and plan trips. Precisely tracking vehicle and informing riders of estimated times of arrival is challenging due to a number of factors, such as traffic congestion, operational delays, varying times taken to load passengers at each stop. In this paper, we introduce a public transportation decision support system for both short-term as well as long-term prediction of arrival bus times. The system uses streaming real-time bus position data, which is updated once every minute, and historical arrival and departure data - available for select stops to predict bus arrival times. Our approach combines clustering analysis and Kalman filters with a shared route segment model in order to produce more accurate arrival time predictions. Experiments show that compared to the basic arrival time prediction model that is currently being used by the city, our system reduces arrival time prediction errors by 25\% on average when predicting the arrival delay an hour ahead and 47\% when predicting within a 15 minute future time window.},

This paper analyzes people's spatio-temporal constraints to accessing supermarkets, and focuses on the transit commuting population. Analysis of commute data from Cincinnati, Ohio shows there are a significant number of residents that have improved access to supermarkets when a grocery shopping trip is made on the way home from work, than if they were to depart from their home location. These results extend previous work showing relatively few automobile commuting residents have better access to supermarkets given their work locations.},

  abstract = {Despite advances in medical technology and public health practices over the past few decades, there has been a steady increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes among low-income urban residents in the US. For this population, maintaining a diet consisting of nutritious foods is complicated by a number of physical and social barriers. In cities, a coalescence of social, spatial, and economic factors influence the availability of healthy food in any given place. The urban food environment contextualizes the structural and individual-level norms that drive daily decision-making about what to eat. Understanding and acting on the processes that reduce these residents' access to healthy foods will make for a healthier urban landscape. This paper advances the discussion of food deserts by using an agent-based model to simulate the impact of various policy interventions on low-income households' consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. Using a simulated population of low-income households in Buffalo, NY, initialized with demographic and geographic data from the US Census and the City of Buffalo, a baseline scenario is established. Four different scenarios are explored in contrast to the baseline, including increasing the frequency that households shop for groceries, increasing the probability convenience stores stock fresh produce, and implementing a mobile market distribution system. The paper concludes by analyzing the effectiveness of the varying strategies, and discussing policy implications.},

  issn = {01436228},
  abstract = {Within the geography, transportation, and public health communities there has been intense interest in better understanding the linkages between health outcomes such as obesity rates and people's access to healthy foods. In this nexus, personal access to healthy food is shaped by a number of individual and geographical factors including people's time available for shopping, the quality of proximal food vendors (e.g. supermarkets vs. convenience stores), and the nature of the transportation systems available to facilitate mobility. Building on recent research in disaggregate accessibility modeling, including that of time geography, this paper describes an individual-level modeling approach for quantifying peoples' food environments. The approach works by measuring the accessibility people have to local food shopping opportunities given their activity patterns and available time budgets. Individuals' food accessibility may be compared to one another and the underlying mobility afforded by the transportation system is accounted for. Moreover, the individual-level measure is such that it may be resolved to places, whereby the aggregation and mapping of multiple individuals' food accessibility experiences is possible. Hence, possible `deserts' or areas of inaccessibility may be identified through a bottom-up analysis of the travel and mobility experience of a representative sample of individuals. These ideas are demonstrated with spatial data from a smaller urban area in Florida. Results show that individual and place-based differences in food accessibility may be delineated with the metrics.},

  abstract = {Rural regions include places where food sources are not evenly distributed, leading to areas of concentration and food deserts\textemdash{}places where few or no grocery stores exist. Individuals are hypothesized to depend on personal connections and the civic structure of where they live to help them solve the problem of food insecurity. We find that residents living in poor rural counties with few grocery stores and perceptions of high civic structure are significantly less likely to be food insecure. A great deal of food giving and receiving is reported, but these personal connections do not decrease the odds of being food insecure. Lower incomes and being younger increase the odds of food insecurity. Our findings suggest that investments in strengthening the social structure of rural communities along with strategies that increase incomes can help households solve the problem of food insecurity.},

Specificially, I argue that social interaction creates opportunities for individuals to gather information about politics that allows them to live beyond personal resouce constraints, thereby supporting the political activity of many people. Using relational data from the South Bend Election Study, this article provides evidence that the effect of social interaction on participation is contingent on the amount of political discussion that occurs in social networks. Additional analysis shows the substantive and theoretical importance of such interaction by explaining how it is distinct from the effect of social group memberships and how it enhances the effect of individual education on the probability of participation. This key contribution of this article is to show that models of political participation that do not account for informal social interaction will be theoretically underspecified. It also shows that such interactions play a crucial role in explicating the role of other factors that predict participation, such as group membership and individual resources.},

Nonetheless, a longstanding concern is that partisan identification slants decision-making. Citizens may support (oppose) policies that they would otherwise oppose (support) in the absence of an endorsement from a political party\textemdash{}this is due in large part to what is called partisan motivated reasoning where individuals interpret information through the lens of their party commitment. We explore partisan motivated reasoning in a survey experiment focusing on support for an energy law. We identify two politically relevant factors that condition partisan motivated reasoning: (1) an explicit inducement to form an ``accurate'' opinion, and (2) cross-partisan, but not consensus, bipartisan support for the law. We further provide evidence of how partisan motivated reasoning works psychologically and affects opinion strength. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for understanding opinion formation and the overall quality of citizens' opinions.},

  abstract = {A model of authoritarianism on a group level of analysis based on Duckitt's concept of authoritarianism is presented. This conceptualization is called group authoritarianism (GA), which is defined as the belief about the appropriate relationship that should exist between groups and their individual members. The process model of group authoritarianism connects traditional authoritarianism theories with the Social Identity Approach. According to this model group-authoritarianism reflects the situation-specific activation of an authoritarian disposition in group contexts. Thus, group authoritarianism provides a perspective according to which personality characteristics and general psychological mechanisms described by Social-Identity Theory (SIT) and Self-Categorization Theory (SCT) interact in predicting intergroup hostility and intergroup discrimination. This article describes the development of a group authoritarianism scale as well as an experimental study that tests the main assumption of the group authoritarianism process model. The results confirm the reliability and validity of the group authoritarianism scales and the main hypothesis of the group authoritarianism model.},

However, this problem can easily be solved by including the average of each individual-level predictors in the group-level regression. We explain
the solution, demonstrate its effectiveness using simulations, show how it can be applied in some commonly-used statistical software, and discuss its potential for substantive modeling.},

Data from over 150,000 survey respondents provide evidence consistent with the theory. Whites from counties that experienced historical civil rights protests are more likely to identify as Democrats and support affirmative action, and less likely to harbor racial resentment against blacks. These individual-level results are politically meaningful\textemdash{}counties that experienced civil rights protests are associated with greater Democratic Party vote shares even today.

The focus of this article is interstate cooperation-multistate efforts to pursue shared agendas or solve common problems. Three mechanisms are examined: interstate compacts, multistate legal actions, and uniform state laws. The data show that during the 1990s, states engaged in all of these behaviors but at differing rates. Furthermore, the explanations for interstate cooperation vary. Government capability proved to be an important explanation but in opposite ways: more capable states join multistate legal actions, and less capable states adopt uniform state laws. The implications for the federal system are considerable: effective interstate cooperation may offer an alternative to federal legislation. For state officials, the implications are equally significant: interstate cooperation spawns administrative networks that fall outside traditional structures.},

  abstract = {This research Integrates apparently
contradictory portrayals of the role of
political parties and electoral competition in American states' public policymaking. From one view, political parties are essentially sincere, leading us to expect conservative or liberal dominance to yield changes in public policies that are in keeping with those ideological leanings. Another set of evidence suggests that parties are for the most part strategic, tailoring their policy outputs to electoral circumstances. We argue that parties are neither wholly sincere nor wholly strategic in their policy positions, but that they blend sincere and strategic impulses according to political conditions. We test this revised theory using cross-sectional state level data pooled over the years 1973-1992. Our results reveal the effects of party strength in government to be conditioned by electoral circumstances. For example, Democrats that dominate state legislatures but were elected in close races exert greater changes in welfare spending effort than Democrats with identical numbers of seats who were elected under less competitive elections. Thus both the number of seats and the difficulty of gaining them have policy consequences. The theory developed here provides a more consistent set of expectations regarding the effects of parties on policymaking than is otherwise drawn from existing research.},

Marginally discussed in the race-to-crime literature are Blacks' perceptions of retribution and justice. We fill this void by using an original survey experiment of 900 Black Americans to examine how exposure to intra- and- intergroup violent crime shapes their policy attitudes and emotional reactions to crime. We find that Black Americans are more likely to support increased prison sentences for violent crimes when the perpetrator is White and the victim is Black, and reduced sentences for ``Black-on-Black'' crime. Our analyses further reveal that Black people express higher levels of anger when the victim is Black and the perpetrator is White; levels of shame and anger also increase in instances of Black-on-Black crime. Given current race relations in the United States, we conclude by speculating about how these emotional reactions might shape one's willingness to participate in the political arena.},

Yet, the meaning of this drop for the larger legitimacy of the Court is not as clear as the poll data themselves. Some believe that dissatisfaction with the Court's rulings threatens the institution's legitimacy. Conventional legitimacy theory, on the other hand, posits a ``reservoir of goodwill'' through which the translation of dissatisfaction into lowered legitimacy is blocked. Positivity theory, with its focus on the legitimizing role of the symbols of judicial authority, provides at least a partial explanation of how legitimacy is maintained in the face of rising disappointment in the Court's rulings. Here, we focus specifically on the relationship between specific and diffuse support and the role judicial symbols play in undermining that connection, concluding that the Court's legitimacy is more secure than many imagine.},

Another way of asking this question is to which do people give a higher priority: their ideology or their partisan a liation? Though much has been said about this long-standing question, it is quite di cult to convincingly test because the concepts are nearly impossible to disentangle in modern America. Ideology and partisanship are normally aligned, and have become even more correlated over time. However, the election of Donald J. Trump presents a unique opportunity to disentangle party attachment from ideological commitment. Using a research design that employs both ``conservative'' and ``liberal'' Trump cues we find that low-knowledge respondents, strong Republicans, Trump-approving respondents, and self-described ``conservatives'' are the most likely to behave like party loyalists and simply accept the Trump cue\textemdash{}in either direction. These results suggest that there are a large number of party loyalists in the United States, that their claims to being a self-defined ``conservative'' are suspect, and that group loyalty is the much more profound motivator of opinion than are any ideological principles.},

However, drawbacks in existing survey data hamper efforts to delineate the relationship between income and representation with precision, especially at the highest income levels. In this paper we use new data to explore the relationship between wealth, the party identity of elected officials, and representation in greater depth. We develop several alternative models of the relationship between income and representation, and compare them with models employed in previous empirical research. We test each of these models, using two different data sets containing large numbers of wealthy individuals and very granular measures of income. Our results suggest that individuals with Democratic congressional representatives experience a fundamentally different type of representation than do individuals with Republican representatives. Individuals with Democratic representatives encounter a mode of representation best described as ``populist,'' in which the relationship between income and representation is flat (if not negative). However, individuals with Republican representatives experience an ``oligarchic'' mode of representation, in which wealthy individuals receive much more representation than those lower on the economic ladder.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a new approach to the problem of testing the existence of a level relatio a dependent variable and a set of regressors, when it is not known with certainty whether regressors are trend- or first-difference stationary. The proposed tests are based on standard Fused to test the significance of the lagged levels of the variables in a univariate equilibri mechanism. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics are non-standard under the null there exists no level relationship, irrespective of whether the regressors are I(0) or I(1). Two sets critical values are provided: one when all regressors are purely I(1) and the other if they 1(0).

Using a novel experimental design, Study 1 demonstrates that anxiety exacerbates the outgroup empathy gap. Study 2 replicates these findings with an explicit measure of outgroup empathy. Study 3 shows that the outgroup empathy gap causes individuals to become less supportive of helping needy outgroup members.

It is easy to assume gridlock that has blocked legislation on gun control follows because of the mass-level polarization on the topic of gun control. My analysis of 28 waves of General Social Survey data from 1972 to 2016 shows this is wrong. My analysis of the data generates four key findings: 1) GOP partisanship does not robustly reduce support for gun control; 2) most `strong' Republicans actually support gun control; 3) polarization of attitudes about gun control is only partial and recent; and 4) our casual assumptions about regional variation in attitudes toward gun control need re-evaluation. I conclude with a discussion of the differences we observe between elite polarization and mass polarization and with implications for the future of gun control advocacy.},

As part of that effort, the HOLC created residential security maps for over 200 cities to grade the riskiness of lending to neighborhoods. We trace out the effects of these maps over the course of the 20th and into the early 21st century by linking geocoded HOLC maps to both Census and modern credit bureau data. Our analysis looks at the difference in outcomes between residents living on a lower graded side versus a higher graded side of an HOLC boundary within highly close proximity to one another. We compare these differences to ``counterfactual'' boundaries using propensity score and other weighting procedures. In addition, we exploit borders that are least likely to have been endogenously drawn. We find that areas that were the lower graded side of HOLC boundaries in the 1930s experienced a marked increase in racial segregation in subsequent decades that peaked around 1970 before beginning to decline. We also find evidence of a long-run decline in home ownership, house values, and credit scores along the lower graded side of HOLC borders that persists today. We document similar long-run patterns among both ``redlined'' and non-redlined neighborhoods and, in some important outcomes, show larger and more lasting effects among the latter. Our results provide strongly suggestive evidence that the HOLC maps had a causal and persistent effect on the development of neighborhoods through credit access.},

While much of this research assumes that the misinformation documented by survey researchers is an accurate reflection of what individuals truly believe, other scholars have suggested that individuals intentionally and knowingly provide misinformation to survey researchers as a way of showing support for their political side. To date, it has been difficult to adjudicate between these two contrasting explanations for misperceptions. However, in this note, we provide such a test. We take advantage of a controversy regarding the relative sizes of crowds at the presidential inaugurations of Donald Trump in 2017 and Barack Obama in 2009 to ask a question where the answer is so clear and obvious to the respondents that nobody providing an honest response should answer incorrectly. Yet, at the same time, the question taps into a salient political controversy that provides incentives for Trump supporters to engage in expressive responding. We find clear evidence of expressive responding; moreover, this behavior is especially prevalent among partisans with higher levels of political interest. Our findings provide support for the notion that at least some of the misinformation reported in surveys is the result of partisan cheerleading rather than genuinely held misperceptions.},

We show party differences are not only as important as income differences for understanding unequal representation, not only that party and purse both matter, but that partisan asymmetries enact shape and constrain income asymmetries. Party trumps the purse when Senators have to take sides. The rich do get what they want more often than the poor, but only from Republican senators, and only when Republican constituents want it. Even that in turn loses to the Republican elite party line. We disentangle these pressures using 50 Senate roll-call votes from eight legislative sessions, on economic, social, and foreign policy.},

But millions of these voters\textemdash{}who are often stereotyped as ``the white working class''\textemdash{}opposed Trump because they oppose his prejudices. These prejudices, meanwhile, have a definite structure, which we argue should be called authoritarian: negatively, they target minorities and women; and positively, they favor domineering and intolerant leaders who are uninhibited about their biases. Multivariate logistic regression shows that, once we take these biases into account, demographic factors (age, education, etc.) lose their explanatory power. The electorate, in short, is deeply divided. Nearly 75\% of Trump supporters count themselves among his enthusiastic supporters, and even ``mild'' Trump voters are much closer in their attitudes to Trump's enthusiasts than they are to nonTrump voters. Polarization is profound, and may be growing.},

Many decades after the closing of the frontier, counties with longer historical frontier experience exhibit more prevalent individualism and opposition to redistribution and regulation. We take several steps towards a causal interpretation, including an instrumental variables approach that exploits variation in the speed of westward expansion induced by national immigration inflows. Using linked historical Census data, we identify mechanisms giving rise to a persistent frontier culture. Selective migration contributed to greater individualism, and frontier conditions may have further shaped behavior and values. We provide evidence suggesting that rugged individualism may be rooted in its adaptive advantage on the frontier and the opportunities for upward mobility through effort.},

Current empirical practice tends to overlook two important problems. First, these models assume a linear interaction effect that changes at a constant rate with the moderator. Second, estimates of the conditional effects of the independent variable can be misleading if there is a lack of common support of the moderator. Replicating 46 interaction effects from 22 recent publications in five top political science journals, we find that these core assumptions often fail in practice, suggesting that a large portion of findings across all political science subfields based on interaction models are modeling artifacts or are at best highly model dependent. We propose a checklist of simple diagnostics to assess the validity of these assumptions and offer flexible estimation strategies that allow for nonlinear interaction effects and safeguard against excessive extrapolation.

We find clear evidence that issue advertising targeted the states of Senate allies throughout the process. But in the period leading up to the conference report and final passage interest groups target the states of pivotal senators.

Using a structural demand model, we find that exposing low-income households to the same availability and prices experienced by high-income households reduces nutritional inequality by 9\%, while the remaining 91\% is driven by differences in demand. These findings contrast with discussions of nutrional inequality that emphasize supply-side factors such as food deserts.},

  abstract = {This project uses multilevel modeling techniques to estimate state-level policy preferences for more and less affluent Americans. We then relate these preferences to actual state policy to assess the responsiveness of state policymakers to public preferences and the extent to which that responsiveness differes for the poor, the middle-class and the affluent. Finally, we examine the influence on representation and representational inequality of state-level characteristics like economic inequality, party competition, partisan polarization, campaign finance regulations, interest group environment, term limits, and legislative professionalization. This paper details our analytic strategy and presents some preliminary results based on the first 12 policy issues we have examined.},

This study explicates such a strategy and tests its efficacy by estimating the impact on House members' roll call votes of the inclusion of highway "demonstration" projects in the 1987 highway and urban mass transit reauthorization by the leadership of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee. The analysis shows that distributive benefits conferred by the leaders did indeed influence members' support for the leaders' legislative goals on that bill.},

  abstract = {As early as the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, classical writers like John Locke, David Hume, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau introduced the concepts of climate of opinion, law of opinion and reputation, and public opinion. In their analyses their emphasis was on the social controls, social pressure dimension of the phenomenon-'all governments rest on opinions." This concept of public opinion permits us to draw a few conclusions: public opinion can be used for social control because of the individual's fear of isolating himself; moreover, public opinion facilitates social integration and social stability, establishes priorities, and confers legitimation.

The focus among scholars primarily on domestic conditions, and only secondarily on the external environment, to explain patterns of political development conforms to the prevailing assumptions of comparativists, international relations scholars, and international lawyers. Over the past decade, however, some scholars have studied the possibility that political institutions within states can be influenced or determined not only by internal factors and the external environment but also by the explicit policies of foreign actors. An emerging body of scholarship examines the efficacy of different policy tools that external actors might use to change the structure of domestic institutions in target states. We review this literature and reach the following conclusions. First, contracting often works, coercion sometimes works, and imposition rarely works. Second, the motivation of initiators matters: to be effective, intervening states must be committed to institutional change. Third, conditions in the target state are consequential: higher levels of development facilitate institutional change, and elite motivations must be aligned with the goals of external actors.},

Due primarily to the aging population of the United States, state and local governments are allocating large and increasing shares of their budgets to expenditures on Medicaid and on retirement benefits that they have promised to their past and current employees. As these expenditures consume more of their budgets, there is less to spend on transportation, parks and recreation, education, public safety, and all the other services that these governments provide.

T/A interventions have yielded mixed results: some are highly successful; others appear to have little impact. We develop a rubric of five ideal-typical ``worlds'' facing transparency that helps to account for this variation in outcomes. Reform based on transparency can face obstacles of collective action, political resistance, and long implementation chains. T/A interventions are more likely to succeed in contextual ``worlds'' with fewer of these obstacles. We find that 16 experimental evaluations of T/A interventions are largely consistent with the theoretical predictions of our five-worlds rubric.},

Instead, research finds that immigration attitudes are shaped by sociotropic concerns about its cultural impacts\textemdash{}and to a lesser extent its economic impacts\textemdash{}on the nation as a whole. This pattern of results has held up as scholars have increasingly turned to experimental tests, and it holds for the United States, Canada, and Western Europe.

Substantive themes covered include the partisan composition of both minority and majority cabinets, the allocation of cabinet portfolios between parties, and the duration of cabinets in minority legislatures. The way forward in this field is identified in terms of the need for more dynamic models that see government formation as a complex system within the broader context of party competition as a whole, and for models that take fundamental account of intraparty politics in their description of the strategic behavior of political parties.},

It has also been argued that transitions to democracy can make states war-prone, but that criticism too has been responded to persuasively.

Thus, efforts to combine the two approaches are rendered unproductive by inevitable inconsistencies of internal logic.

Classical political philosophy overcomes nihilism not by proving the existence of universal rules of conduct, but by seeing what is highest in man. Modern philosophers departed from the classical approach in an unsuccessful attempt to meet the challenge of revealed religion. This failure led them to engage in a political-scientific project whose ultimate purpose was to refute revealed religion. Although the project failed, it led to the concealment of the most fundamental problems of human beings. The recovery of those problems is Strauss's great legacy.},

Conceptual distinctions have been drawn between ``federalism'' as a normative term, ``federal political systems'' as a descriptive term referring to a broad genus of federal arrangements, and ``federation'' as a particular species within that genus. The extensive literature on the design and operation of federal systems is reviewed, with particular attention to asymmetry among constituent units, degrees of noncentralization, financial relationships, the impact of federative institutions and the courts, and the development of multi-tiered federal systems. Federal processes illustrated by patterns of formation and evolution, the significance of the increasingly global economy, intergovernmental relations, the impact of cultural, ethnic and national diversities, and the pathology of federal systems are also considered.},

The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are assessed, as are some of the more generic problems that may be associated with all four approaches. The two approaches that appear best suited to the specification and classification of party families are those based on the origin of parties and their ideology, but these should be developed in parallel rather than as alternatives. Both tap into what parties are rather than what parties do and hence are more likely to uncover core identities and shared political goals.},

The second focuses on the implications of reinvention for accountability and related democratic concerns. The degree to which reinvention ideas appear to be taking root at the various levels of the federal system also receives attention. The authors conclude that the reinvention movement should not be dismissed as the latest fad, but rather as the fount of several plausible hypotheses that should be tested further. They also suggest that the American political system will place major, although not necessarily insurmountable, barriers in the way of sustaining reinvention.},

How do existing theories about trade policy explain this puzzle? Three sets of explanations are prominent. First, many focus on changes in trade policy preferences among domestic actors, either societal groups or political leaders. Second, scholars examine changes in political institutions to account for such policy change. Third, they seek explanations in changes in the international political system. Large-scale changes in political institutions, especially in the direction of democracy, may be necessary for the kind of massive trade liberalization that has occured. But changes in preferences cannot be overlooked in explaining the rush to free trade. Moreover, the influence of internationl institutions has been important. Finally, the reciprocal impact of trade on domestic politics and the international political system is important. If the rush to free trade is sustained, will its impact be benign or malign?},

In particular, when political actors are primarily concerned with the current election and have good information about the relative chances of potential competitors, two different M + 1 rules apply in an M-seat district. First, the number of competitors entering a given race tends to be no more than M + 1; second, when more than M + 1 competitors do enter a race, votes tend to concentrate on at most M + 1 of them. We know much less about cross-district coordination, in which potentially separate local party systems merge to form a national party system.

But this does not mean that people and their politics are irrational. Bounded rationality asserts that decision makers are intendedly rational; that is, they are goaloriented and adaptive, but because of human cognitive and emotional architecture, they sometimes fail, occasionally in important decisions. Limits on rational adaptation are of two types: procedural limits, which limit how we go about making decisions, and substantive limits, which affect particular choices directly. Rational analysis in institutional contexts can serve as a standard for adaptive, goal-oriented human behavior. In relatively fixed task environments, such as asset markets or elections, we should be able to divide behavior into adaptive, goal-oriented behavior (that is, rational action) and behavior that is a consequence of processing limits, and we should then be able to measure the deviation. The extent of deviation is an empirical issue. These classes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, and they may be examined empirically in situations in which actors make repeated similar choices.},

However, differences remain in how scholars in the two traditions approach empirical problems. The contrast of rational choice's emphasis on institutions as coordination mechanisms that generate or sustain equilibria versus historical institutionalism's emphasis on how institutions emerge from and are embedded in concrete temporal processes serves as the foundation for the second half of the essay, which assesses our progress in understanding institutional formation and change. Drawing on insights from recent historical institutional work on ``critical junctures'' and on ``policy feedbacks,'' the article proposes a way of thinking about institutional evolution and path dependency that provides an alternative to equilibrium and other approaches that separate the analysis of institutional stability from that of institutional change.},

However, 50 years after decolonization, one needs to look beyond colonial rule for explanations. The essay develops a general model based on a rational choice perspective to explain political stability through institutional arrangements. In its application of this model to South Asia, the chapter suggests that political stability is conditional (a) on the capacity of the postcolonial state to innovate new institutions and (b) on the ability of its new political elites to integrate modern and premodern political structures and values within the institutional set-up and to consult the masses periodically through a democratic political process.

Institutionalist analyses differ regarding the theoretical role of institutions and actor preferences. We classify institutionalist approaches to the EU by their theoretical treatment (exogenous or endogenous) of institutions and preferences. Analyses at the research frontier transcend these categories and offer the promise of an improved understanding of EU politics and a greater contribution by EU studies to the broader discipline of political science.},

  abstract = {American exceptionalism is the oldest and most contentious of the alleged national exceptionalisms\textemdash{}arguments that a given nation must be understood in essentially idiosyncratic fashion. John Winthrop, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Karl Marx helped develop and sustain an American variant for the first 350 years of a separate American political life. Modern political scientists have addressed the notion in a more systematic and methodologically self-conscious manner during the past half century. Nevertheless, much of the argument revolves around conceptual issues, operational difficulties, and empirical traps, so that these must provide the contours of the subject here. Two major recent books with sharply divergent conclusions, both marshaling extensive empirical evidence, serve not only as a means of updating the classical argument and of presenting its modern opposition. Both also suggest\textemdash{}indeed, contribute\textemdash{}further reasons for the continuing lure of a difficult and divisive notion.},

The chapter shows that these assumptions are a poor foundation for policy analysis. Findings from carefully controlled laboratory experiments that challenge the first assumption are summarized. A different assumption that humans are fallible, boundedly rational, and normusing is adopted. The complexity of using rules as tools to change the structure of commons dilemmas is then discussed, drawing on extensive research on rules in field settings. Viewing all policies as experiments with a probability of failure, recent research on a different form of general organization\textemdash{}that of complex adaptive systems\textemdash{}is applied to the process of changing rules. The last sections examine the capabilities and limits of a series of completely independent resource governance systems and the importance of encouraging the evolution of polycentric governance systems.},

  abstract = {Prominent scholars engaged in comparative research on democratic regimes are in sharp disagreement over the choice between a dichotomous or graded approach to the distinction between democracy and nondemocracy. This choice is substantively important because it affects the findings of empirical research. It is methodologically important because it raises basic issues, faced by both qualitative and quantitative analysts, concerning appropriate standards for justifying choices about concepts. In our view, generic claims that the concept of democracy should inherently be treated as dichotomous or graded are incomplete. The burden of demonstration should instead rest on more specific arguments linked to the goals of research. We thus take the pragmatic position that how scholars understand and operationalize a concept can and should depend in part on what they are going to do with it. We consider justifications focused on the conceptualization of democratization as an event, the conceptual requirements for analyzing subtypes of democracy, the empirical distribution of cases, normative evaluation, the idea of regimes as bounded wholes, and the goal of achieving sharper analytic differentiation.},

Rather than suddenly appearing, most preferences emerge from interactions between individuals and their environment. This aspect of preference formation poses a concrete challenge: to uncover the mechanics of these interactions in important social contexts. We then describe political science research that meets this challenge. We find an expansive literature that clarifies how phenomena such as parties, campaigns, and the need to act stategically affect preferences. This work provides many widely applicable insights.},

Researchers have been divided into two groups - those who study leaders and those who study publics. The research programs have also divided between those who use emotion to explain reliance on early experience that dominates contemporary judgment and those who use emotion to explain why people respond to the immediate contemporary circumstances around them. More recently, theory and research have attempted to reconcile these two seemingly contradictory roles by integrating them. Emotion's role in politics is pervasive both because emotion enables contemporary circumstances to be quickly evaluated. More recently still, theoretical models and supporting evidence suggest that there are multiple channels of emotional evaluations.},

Existing theories of union organization and collective bargaining institutions are largely successful in explaining both the trends over time and much of the cross-national variataion from 1950 to 1980, but they fail to acount for the dramatic declines in union strength that some (but not all) countries have experienced since 1980.},

  abstract = {After decades of neglect, civic education is back on the agenda of political science in the United States. Despite huge increases in the formal educational attainment of the US population during the past 50 years, levels of political knowledge have barely budged. Today's college graduates know no more about politics than did high school graduates in 1950. Recent research indicates that levels of political knowledge affect the acceptance of democratic principles, attitudes toward specific issues, and political participation. There is evidence that political participation is in part a positional good and is shaped by relative as well as absolute levels of educational attainment. Contrary to findings from 30 years ago, recent research suggests that traditional classroom-based civic education can significantly raise political knowledge. Service learning - a combination of community-based civic experience and systematic classroom reflection on that experience - is a promising innovation, but program evaluations have yielded mixed results. Longstanding fears that private schools will not shape democratic citizens are not supported by the evidence.},

Recent formal work on these issues draws very heavily on Rubinstein's (1982) seminal analysis of the bargaining problem and the research that flowed from it. There is now what might be called a standard or canonical model of the origins of war that sees this outcome as a bargaining breakdown. This essay reviews this standard model and current efforts to extend it to the areas of (a) multilateral bargaining, which is at the heart of old issues such as balancing and bandwagoning as well as newer ones such as the role of third-party mediation; (b) the effects of domestic politics on international outcomes; (c) efforts to explicitly model intra-war bargaining; and (d ) dynamic commitment problems.},

Research initially focused on whether communist rule had created distinctive forms of cleavage in the region as a whole, or indeed obliterated social capacity
to form any structured social or ideological divisions. The results of this work, however, have tended to support a more differentiated and less sui generis understanding in which the character of cleavages varies considerably across the region. Debate has turned to accounting for the formation and variation in cleavages by reference to factors
such as long-standing cultural legacies, forms of communist rule and modes of
transition from it, the effects of social structure and individual social experience in the post-communist period, and the impact of institutions and party strategies.},

We review the extensive literature on corporatism since the 1970s and consider its applicability in the contemporary period.

Since 1945, the study of Congress has gone through an anglophile responsible-party phase, championed especially by William Yandell Elliott at Harvard, followed by a sociologically oriented legislative-behavior phase, identified in one generation with Lewis Anthony Dexter, Stephen K. Bailey, David Truman, and
especially Ralph K. Huitt at Wisconsin, and in the next generation with Richard Fenno, Charles O. Jones, Donald R. Matthews, and H. Douglas Price, among others. A third, contemporary intellectual orientation is identified most strongly with rational choice scholars, especially from the University of Rochester. The agenda of political science is formed not only by the literature but by events. Hence, the congressional reforms
of the 1970s were influential in shaping the literature, as were such organizational
innovations as the Congressional Fellowship Program and the Study of Congress, both projects of the American Political Science Association.},

  abstract = {Swedish political science has a long pedigree. The Johan Skytte professorship
of discourse and politics was established at Uppsala University in 1622, although political science teaching and research did not begin until the 1860s. Today,
the discipline is represented at all 10 Swedish universities and at a number of other centers for higher education. Early Swedish political science gravitated toward constitutional law, history, and philosophy. In principle, the discipline today deals with all possible aspects of politics; as far as domestic politics research is concerned, special
emphasis has been given to analysis of ideas, local politics, interest organizations, and political parties, as well as public administration and public policy. Contacts with the outside world have been close; different worldwide theories and methods have successively
been incorporated. The relations between the discipline and the surrounding
Swedish society have also been close and the reputation and visibility of the discipline fairly high.},

For Rawls, public reason is a substantive set of principles to be used to answer fundamental questions, whose content varies with the context in which these questions arise. Habermas, on the
other hand, endorses the public use of reason, which provides criteria determining the universal validity of moral norms, though it does not itself ground substantive norms. Ironically, at the global level Rawls's substantive principles of public reason are more inclusive than Habermas's formalist account, which rules out moral and legal systems
that Rawls's theory would accommodate.},

It depends on whether the trade represents vulnerability or sensitivity interdependence. Portfolio investment also does not represent a tie that binds politically. Even more important, foreign direct investment (FDI) represents a link that is costly (and timeconsuming)
to break. Thus, FDI links between countries are more likely to reduce
conflict than trading links. Evidence shows that symmetrical FDI is the most stable guarantor of low conflict between countries. One factor generating conflict may be that scarce factors of production are in political command. Abundant factors, now more generally in power among developed states, may be partly responsible for the diminishment of conflict among these states in recent years.},

The findings they reach and conclusions they draw can have significant social implications and are sometimes controversial. As a result, audiences can be skeptical about the rigor and relevance of the knowledge claims that political scientists produce. For these reasons, being a political scientist means facing myriad questions about how we know what we claim to know. Transparency can help political scientists address these questions. An emerging literature and set of practices suggest that sharing more data and providing more information about our analytic and interpretive choices can help others understand the rigor and relevance of our claims. At the same time, increasing transparency can be costly and has been contentious. This review describes opportunities created by, and difficulties posed by, attempts to increase transparency. We conclude that, despite the challenges, consensus about the value and practice of transparency is emerging within and across political science's diverse and dynamic research communities.},

It addresses the long-term decline in trust and potential causes for this decline, with an emphasis on the effects of partisanship, polarization, performance, process, and media priming. While dispositions can anchor trust levels, the dominant research findings show that the sources of variation and change in trust are political, if multifaceted, in nature. We discuss new versions of standard measures, call for a renewed look at the distinction between trust in authorities and trust in the regime, review ongoing work on how and why trust matters, and recommend broadening the foci of mistrust to include antiestablishment sentiments and attacks on electoral integrity. How trust intervenes between perceptions of political processes and compliance with authoritative commands is a critical domain for additional research. We conclude with a caveat against confidence that the decline in trust can be quickly or easily reversed.},

We argue that the institutions ensuring capacity and the processes that bring them into being vary.

This article seeks to place the study of democratic backsliding on sturdier conceptual, operational, and theoretical foundations. Conceptually, the challenge of backsliding is to define changes that take place within a political regime. Methodologically, the challenge involves measurement of intraregime changes, as alternative coding schemes change the population of units that have experienced democratic backsliding. Theoretical challenges are dual: First, despite a rich and diverse literature, we lack readily available theories to explain backsliding, and second, the theoretical debates that do exist\textemdash{}centered on the causes of democratic transitions, democratic breakdowns, authoritarian resilience, and democratic consolidation\textemdash{}remain unresolved. We consider how these theories might be called into service to explain backsliding. By doing so, the article aims to set the terms of the debate to create a common focal point around which research can coalesce.},

  abstract = {The last 20 years have witnessed an impressive outpouring of comparative politics research examining urban politics in the developing world. This research advances our understanding of phenomena such as clientelism, law and order, and local public goods provision. Scholarship could be strengthened, however, through more careful attention to how the urban setting of this research affects the politics examined. This article proposes two distinct ways in which urban politics can be conceptualized: politics taking place in urban agglomerations, characterized by large, diverse populations settled at high densities; or politics taking place within the boundaries of city jurisdictions, possessing legal powers and responsibilities distinct from those at other tiers of government or in rural areas. Adopting either of these conceptualizations illuminates new avenues for empirical work, theoretical innovation, and improved measurement. This article also shows that recent scholarship has neglected important, and fundamentally political, topics such as urban political economy, land markets, and environmental harms. Engaging with these areas would allow political scientists to revisit classic questions regarding the institutional influences on economic growth, the politics of redistribution, and the determinants of collective action.},

Voting theorists have used the term in a completely different way, identifying an unusual type of tactical voting as protest voting. Protest voting also occurs when voters cast blank, null, or spoiled ballots. There are also instances when protest voting is organized and directed by political elites. Finally, several countries provide voters with the option of casting a vote for ``None of the Above,'' which some see as a form of protest voting. In addition to developing this taxonomy, we discuss the analytical and empirical challenges confronting research on each type of protest voting.},

The theory, however, leaves a number of theoretical and empirical issues unresolved. The ``invisible primary'' hypothesis has performed poorly in recent presidential elections. More importantly, we argue that the next generation of party theorizing needs to account for the distinctive roles and capacities of officeholders and voters, and to reengage the idea of formal parties as institutional intermediaries between groups, politicians, and voters.},

Although these states do not feature ideal-type institutions, they are not weak. Instead, economic and political elites are complicit in enforcing a system of material inequality and uneven democratic incorporation maintained by violence. As politicized security agencies become incapacitated and repressive, citizens turn to nonstate security providers for protection, from private firms to criminals and insurgents, increasing social violence and obscuring the state origins of what we term privilege violence.},

There is now a substantial literature on redistributive politics in multidimensional policy spaces, but it tends to be very technical and frequently misinterpreted, if not ignored. This purpose of this article is to review this relatively new literature using simple graphical representations, focusing on the key assumptions, intuitions, and results. We show how issue bundling, issue salience, and the distribution of preferences can affect redistribution, and we discuss the role of political institutions in inducing particular outcomes. We also highlight the opportunities for dialogue between formal models and more constructivist approaches by exploring the effects of political entrepreneurs manipulating salience, institutions, and even identities.},

While historical warfare was very common across both units, representative government flourished only in Europe. We suggest that the relationship between violent conflict and political development depends on the underlying political geography context. In Europe, political fragmentation was rampant. Thus, conflict tended to be external (i.e., interstate), and attack threats were multidirectional. Furthermore, exit ability was high in this context. Elites were therefore in a strong bargaining position to demand political representation in return for new tax revenue. China, by contrast, was politically centralized. Here, conflict tended to be internal, attack threats were unidirectional, and exit ability was low. The emperor was thus powerful enough to extract tax funds without surrendering political control. In this context, violent conflict promoted autocratic re-entrenchment. We conclude by briefly analyzing the relationships between political geography, historical conflict, and political development in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.},

It then articulates a key challenge posed by undertheorization of aid allocation, which is largely nonrandom, making the causal effects difficult to infer.

We review this body of research, analyzing both the comparative-historical analysis (CHA) and modern political economy (MPE) research traditions as applied to the study of communism, imperialism, and authoritarianism. We restrict our focus to the sizeable subset of arguments that meets a relatively strict definition of legacies, i.e., arguments that locate the roots of present-day outcomes in causal factors operative during an extinct political order. For all their differences, the CHA and MPE approaches both face the challenges of convincingly identifying the sources of historical persistence and of reckoning with alternative channels of causation. We find that mechanisms of persistence in legacy research generally belong to one of three main categories. While both traditions acknowledge the role of institutions in historical persistence, CHA research tends to emphasize the lasting power of coalitions, whereas work in MPE often argues for the persistence of cognitions. We argue that, at their best, CHA and MPE approaches yield complementary insights. Further progress in legacy research will benefit from greater cross-fertilization across research traditions and deeper recognition of commonalities across communist, imperialist, and authoritarian regimes.},

  abstract = {Normative theorists of corruption have developed an institutional conception that is distinct from both the individualist approaches focused on quid pro quo exchanges and other institutional approaches found in the literature on developing societies. These theorists emphasize the close connection between patterns of corruption and the legitimate functions of institutions. The corruption benefits the institution while undermining it. Reforms therefore should be directed toward finding alternatives for the functions the corruption serves. Also, institutional corruption does not require that its perpetrators have corrupt motives, and it is not limited to political institutions. This review examines four leading theories and discusses criticisms of their approach. A tripartite framework for analyzing the elements of institutional corruption is proposed. Although the theories are useful for distinguishing institutional corruption from the more familiar forms of individual corruption, they could be enriched by giving greater attention to the work on individual corruption in its structural forms in developing societies.},

Considering it as a subject in itself brings out some important principles. The general literature on negotiation falls into five categories: advice from practitioners, studies of particular cases or contexts, statistical tests of data, psychological theories with experiments, and game theory models. Each approach complements the others, but there has been too little interaction among them. Game models, in particular, are important for the international context, which involves more planning and more experienced actors. They resist the generalizations to which other approaches are prone, often showing that whether a move is well-advised or mistaken depends on some easy-to-overlook detail.},

Our review shows that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by the evidence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing policies. Likewise, voter preferences for the redistribution of wealth depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures, and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair. Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic process is captured by the rich; however, the evidence explaining when, where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful avenue for future research.},

But features of the climate change problem elicit some distinctive determinants of opinion, including individuals' trust in science, risk processing, and personal experience.

The prevailing consensus among movement scholars is that the prospect for movement emergence is facilitated by the confluence of three factors: the expansion of political opportunities, the availability of mobilizing structures, and cognitive and affective mobilization through framing processes. The author then applies each of these factors to the case of climate change, arguing that (a) awareness of the issue developed during an especially inopportune period in American politics, (b) the organizations that arose to address the issue were ill suited to the kind of grassroots mobilization characteristic of successful movements, and (c) the amorphous nature of the issue played havoc with efforts at strategic framing.},

Empirically, a small number of studies have employed suitable research designs and generally find modest, if any, turnout effects of voter identification laws.

The second meaning treated governance as a synonym for public administration, that is, effective implementation of state policy. Interest in this topic was driven by awareness that global poverty was rooted in corruption and weak state capacity. The third meaning of governance was the regulation of social behavior through networks and other nonhierarchical mechanisms. The first and third of these strands of thought downplay traditional state authority and favor new transnational or civil society actors.

Synthesizing research across academic fields, we propose that attitudes are a core constituent element of individual temperament, with far-reaching influence on many aspects of psychological and social functioning. Once instantiated, political values guide human behavior across domains, including affiliation into social networks, mate selection, physiological perception, psychological disposition, personality characteristics, morality construction, decision making, and selection into the very environments that influence political preferences. Here, we reconceptualize the ontology of political attitudes and ideologies from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective and as a combination of biological and environmental processes that drive an entire suite of coordinated downstream effects across the life course.},

We explicate several methodological misunderstandings widespread across disciplines by revisiting the controversy concerning the validity of RD design when applied to close elections. Although many researchers invoke the local or as-if-random assumption near the threshold, it is more stringent than the required continuity assumption. We show that this seemingly subtle point determines the appropriateness of various statistical methods and changes our understanding of how sorting invalidates the design. When multiple-testing problems are also addressed, we find that evidence for sorting in US House elections is substantially weaker and highly dependent on estimation methods. Finally, we caution that despite the temptation to improve the external validity, the extrapolation of RD estimates away from the threshold sacrifices the design's advantage in internal validity.},

Considerable research suggests that low-income voters' opinions count for even less than would be implied by their low participation rate, a matter that should continue to be the subject of research. Seemingly contrary to any upper-income bias to policy making, major legislation usually moves policy in the direction favored by low-income voters (e.g., redistribution, government programs). Upper-income voters and interest groups, however, are able to slow the pace of liberal change.},

Second, how do electoral rules regulating the electoral calendar and vote fusion affect mobilizational spillovers and, hence, incentives to build mobilizational alliances?

Second, although scholarship suggests that both congruence and responsiveness have declined since the 1970s, they are not low by historic standards; rather, mass opinion was particularly influential in that decade. Third, the literature rebuts conventional explanations for the post-1970s decline and suggests that standard proposals for how to reverse it would not significantly alter the impact of mass preferences on policy.

  abstract = {For decades, scholars have uncovered evidence that male and female legislators' priorities and preferences differ and that women's inclusion brings to elite-level politics a more cooperative leadership style. They also point to the symbolic benefits associated with more diversity among candidates and office holders. Although these effects are not uniform, there is no question among political scientists that women's presence in US political institutions bears directly on issues of substantive and symbolic representation. Accordingly, it is important to understand why we have so few women in politics, whether they are willing to run for office, what happens when they do, and the extent to which their presence systematically affects the legislative process. I cover each of these topics in this review, emphasizing the latest and most interesting research that speaks to these questions.},

  abstract = {The literature on term limits has burgeoned in recent years. This paper looks at both the empirical and normative studies, exploring how the term-limit debate is confounded by both fact and value disagreements. We identify four
schools of thought with respect to the desirability of term limits and conclude
that, because people start from different normative perspectives, findings
about term-limit effects can be interpreted in very different ways. Reviewing the literature on electoral impacts, we discovered that term limits have increased turnover most noticeably in the more professionalized legislatures.
The length of term limitations and the types of legislatures that adopt them
are critical explanatory variables. The implications for the internal workings
of legislatures and the balance of power are less well documented by scholars,
but there is a great deal of testimony from legislators and lobbyists that
term limits have changed their operations in important ways.},

Yet much of this work has focused on composition rather than context and on public forms of political expression rather than ones that occur outside the public eye. Dissent in rural communities may be especially risky, because residents lack anonymity and rely on local patronage. This study offers evidence that challenges existing theories and concepts of opinion expression and political organizing, suggesting that when faced with an opposing community, rural residents may organize and express their opinions in secret. Through a series of indepth interviews, this research examined the experiences of a secret political organization of 136 registered members in rural Texas. This study explored how members expressed their opinions and organized in secret, why they do so, and the effect this had on their political engagement in public.},

We update this model and apply it in the context of urban transit policymaking, using revenue flows to and from the government as an indicator of both recursive behavior and intergovernmental influence. The results suggest that these modifications reestablish the explanatory power of the stages model.},

This book presents new empirical evidence that the punctuated equilibrium theory of policy dynamics fits the facts of environmental policy change and can explain how stable policies can suddenly unravel in discontinuous change. The distinguished contributors to the volume apply the theory to a wide range of important environmental and resource issues and assess case histories in water, forestry, fisheries, public lands, energy and climate some of which resulted in breakthroughs, others in stalemate. They offer insights into the political conditions and tactics that are likely to produce these disparate outcomes. Every professional, activist, and student concerned with promoting (or resisting) change in environmental and natural resources policies will find this up-to-date book an invaluable guide.},

The purpose of this article is to determine why this pronounced, but temporary, shift in public opinion occurred. We use data from the CPS National Election Studies to examine several explanations for temporal variability in citizens' attitudes toward welfare spending. Our results show that these changes follow similar variations in media content. Individual-level opinion change was also based entirely upon political motivations (e.g., ideology and partisanship) rather than economic beliefs or racial attitudes. We argue that this provides evidence, admittedly somewhat indirect, that elite rhetoric guides and shapes mass opinions.},

I develop hypotheses of the relationships between law enforcement, state and local policies, and the preferences of elected officials, bureaucrats, and the public. Using survey and demographic data, I find that local hate crime law enforcement is driven by the presence of state hate crime policies, the support and efforts of bureaucrats, the tractability of the hate crime problem, police funding and training, and public preferences. Law enforcement does not appear to be significantly influenced by the preferences of elected officials, local hate crime policies, or administrative procedures for hate crime cases. Thus, although political control by local elected officials is weak, state officials and citizens have some influence over local hate crime law enforcement.},

Alternate hypotheses argue that the local-level implementation environment and the resources that the government commits to implementation have an impact on enforcement levels.

This question is critical at a time of continuing devolution of regulatory authority to the states. We employ a database of information on nearly 4,000 S\&Ls in this period to understand the factors that led some of them to fail. We find that state-chartered S\&Ls failed at higher rates than federally chartered firms, but that the extremely high failure rate of Texas-chartered S\&Ls explains all of this difference. The actions of a single, large state can make an enormous difference in the American federal system of regulation. We also find that stock-owned S\&Ls failed at a higher rate than mutually owned S\&Ls, and that S\&Ls chartered in jurisdictions with more autonomous regulatory structures failed at a higher rate. Thus, when the principal-agent relationship in S\&L regulation was weakest, S\&L failures were most prevalent.},

  abstract = {Proposition 227, passed by California voters in 1998, aimed to dismantle bilingual programs in public schools and to replace them with English-only programs. Bilingual education, a long-standing program in California, involved mostly Hispanic students of limited English skills who were taught initially in their native language, and then were gradually transitioned into English-only classes. Using individual-level data from one southern California school district, I find that in 1998, before Proposition 227, limited-English-proficient (LEP) students enrolled in bilingual classes had lower scores in reading than LEP students who were not enrolled in bilingual classes, and who were, in general, more proficient in English. In math, bilingual students had test scores as good as those of non-bilingual LEPs. But in 1999, after Proposition 227, the same set of bilingual students had reading and math scores that were no worse than those of non-bilingual LEPs. Proposition 227, which interrupted bilingual programs and emphasized English instruction, did not set bilingual LEP students back relative to non-bilingual LEPs, and it may have even benefited them.},

  abstract = {For the past several decades, scholars have studied the role of policy research in decision making. Depending how ``use'' is measured, the results have indicated only modest or indirect impacts. This study takes another direction to studying knowledge utilization, comparing the influence of nonpartisan policy research organizations in 19 states on their principal clients: state legislators. Nonpartisan research agencies represent a particularly rigorous test since the literature on knowledge utilization questions whether nonpartisan policy analysis organizations (NPROs) can remain neutral and contribute meaningfully to policymaking. Further, this analysis is comparative across states, studies institutions rather than specific reports or policy domains, and examines multiple types of ``use.'' Using the results of surveys of both agencies and legislators, the results indicate a strong association between the size and type of policy research organizations and legislators' assessments of use, even controlling for political and ideological factors. This suggests that policy analysis organizations\textemdash{}even those in a highly politicized environment\textemdash{}have a significant impact on policymaking, mainly by providing information and analysis to decision makers but also in influencing public policy outcomes.},

Do disenfranchisement laws disparately impact black voters? I argue that disenfranchisement policies target black citizens and impact black voters disparately compared with white voters. I show that disenfranchisement laws have a disparate impact on the black community that becomes increasingly disproportionate as disenfranchisement laws increase in severity. I find that disenfranchisement policies have a significant independent effect on voting rights in the black community and do not have a similar effect on white voters. I conclude that the ability of the black community to achieve adequate representation is substantially diminished as fewer and fewer blacks qualify for voter registration.},

  abstract = {This article identifies the predictors of child poverty rates at the state level before and after the adoption and implementation of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The analysis shows that the most important state-level factors that influence child poverty rates are demographics, the health and viability of the state economy, and often the generosity, inclusiveness, and quality of state welfare programs. States with large numbers of black citizens, and those that score highest on infant mortality, teen births, births to unmarried women, children living with a parent without a high school degree, and children living with a single parent have the highest rates of child poverty. Child poverty rates are lowest in states that suffer less unemployment, and in wealthier states. States that score higher on per capita personal income, tax revenues, and taxable resources have lower child poverty rates. While specific ``tough'' welfare policies adopted by some states seem to have no impact on child poverty rates, we tested for the first time a sophisticated measure of the overall quality of state welfare programs. The analysis reveals that the global quality of a state's welfare programs is often an independent predictor of child poverty. States with the most generous, inclusive, and supportive welfare programs have done the best job of lowering and containing child poverty.},

  abstract = {Under Social Security privatization, workers would be allowed to divert some of the money that currently goes to Social Security into private accounts. This would expose them to market risk, that is, the risk of a substantial drop in equity prices or of a prolonged bear market. This could result in generations of workers with less money than they thought they would have for retirement. Depending on a worker's birth date, if the privatization approach proposed by President Bush's Commission to Strengthen Social Security had been enacted at the start of the Social Security program, the retirement benefits generated from putting 10\% of earnings in a private account for 35 years would have ranged from 100\% to less than 20\% relative to pre-retirement earnings. The extraordinarily high retirement income generated from the booming 1990s stock market was the equivalent of winning the generational lottery\textemdash{}unlikely to be repeated regularly. Even under these beneficial circumstances, a privatized system could have cost the government more than \$1 trillion in today's dollars over the past 3 decades if the government decided to help out those who accumulated too little for retirement. The primary alternative to a government bailout of the Social Security system, older workers working longer, would likely not generate the desired results. Workers wanting to work longer would create labor market pressures typically at times when unemployment is already high.},

Most studies today use event history analysis (EHA) to focus almost exclusively on one policy area at a time at the expense of a broader understanding of innovativeness as a characteristic of states. To return to the concept of innovativeness more broadly, our study revisits and updates the original approach taken by Walker by updating his average innovation scores with new data covering more than 180 different policies. We use these data to construct a new, dynamic measure of innovativeness that addresses biases and shortcomings in the original measure and we provide measures of uncertainty for both. These new scores build on the logic of EHA to address issues such as right-censoring and to facilitate measuring changes in innovativeness over time. We then compare the two measures of innovativeness and evaluate differences across states, spatial patterns, and changes in innovativeness over time.},

Hypotheses: Voter choice in this three-candidate race is a function of economic perceptions, issue and ideological positions of voters and candidates, or voter anger.
Methods: Multinomial probit analysis of 1992 National Election Studies data including individual-specific and alternative-specific variables. Simulations based on counterfactual scenarios of ideological positions of the candidates and of voter perceptions of the economy.
Results: The economy was the dominant factor in accounting for voter decisions in 1992, and Clinton, not Perot, was the beneficiary of economic discontent. While issues (mainly abortion) and ideology did play some role, Clinton was not perceived by the electorate as a New Democrat. We find little support for the hypothesis of angry voting. Last, Perot took more votes from Bush than from Clinton.},

We demonstrate that pre-election polls consistently underestimate support for female candidates when compared to white male candidates.

Using the Center for Political Studies (CPS) 1972 Convention Delegate Study, this article investigates the interrelationships of family roles, subjective conflict, and political ambition.

 wide class of electoral systems-or to show the limits of such extension. The factors examined are the district magnitude, the electoral formula, the number of votes each voter is allowed to cast, whether voters can cumulate their votes, and whether voters can "partially abstain." I suggest a crude division of electoral systems into those producing predominantly centripetal incentives and those producing predominantly centrifugal incentives. Among the factors found to produce centripetal incentives, at least in noncumulative systems, are the following: increases in the number of votes per voter; outlawry of "partial abstention"; and decreases in the district magnitude. In systems allowing the cumulation of votes, matters are a bit different.},

Specifically, we maintain that political sophistication dramatically influences the relative importance of personal and national economic judgments in shaping presidential candidate preference. Pocketbook voting, we argue, should be common only among relatively sophisticated voters, who are able to make the associative linkage between changes in their personal financial status and governmental policy. Additionally, we hypothesize that sociotropic evaluations should be most influential for less sophisticated voters. Low sophisticates, we argue, will tend to assume that the national economy is entirely in the President's hands (and vote accordingly), whereas more sophisticated voters understand that the economy is affected by many actors and conditions that are largely beyond the President's control. Testing our theory using data from 1992, 1996, and 1998, we find strong support for our hypotheses.},

We present a theory of heterogeneous attribution, where an individual's level ofpolitical sophistication conditions his or her ability to attribute responsibility for economic conditions to governmental actors. In contrast to previous literature, we argue that higher, not lower, levels ofpolitical sophistication prompt citizens to "vote their pocketbook." Using data from surveys done in conjunction with recent elections in all of these countries, we find that more politically sophisticated respondents are more likely to make use of pocketbook evaluations in their decisions to support or oppose the incumbent government.

The potential benefits and costs of five common political heuristics are discussed. A new dynamic process-tracing methodology is employed to directly observe the use of these five heuristics by voters in a mock presidential election campaign. We find that cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex. A hypothesized interaction between political sophistication and heuristic use on the quality of decision making is obtained across several different experiments, however. As predicted, heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices. A situation in which experts can be led astray by heuristic use is also illustrated. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for strategies to increase input from under-represented groups into the political process.},

The latter group includes habitual nonvoters whose differences from primary voters would be attributable not to the primary process but to general patterns of participation in the United States. Second, the article argues ideology must be defined as more than extremism. Ideology can be construed as a sophisticated belief system or a psychological identification.

In this article, we attempt to gain a better understanding of this effect by comparing the survey responses of vote-choice questions that provide party labels and those that do not. We show that less educated survey respondents are substantially less likely to express a vote preference when party labels are not available to them. In addition, we also find evidence that those who can state a vote intention in nonpartisan races are less able to link their candidate choice to their party identification. We conclude by demonstrating that, when surveys do not provide partisan cues, the small number of respondents who are willing to state their vote intentions and the large number of those who appear to be guessing create great difficulties for pollsters trying to predict election results.},

We hypothesize that in more closed primary systems, control over candidate nominations by ideological extremists will translate into a higher likelihood that extreme candidates win in the general election. We hypothesize that in more open systems, participation by a wider spectrum of the electorate means that candidates must appeal to more moderate voters, leading to the election of more moderate andidates. Using pooled cross-section time-series regression analysis, we find that U.S. representatives from states with closed primaries take policy positions that are furthest from their district's estimated median voter's ideal positions. Representatives from states with semi-closed primaries are the most moderate. We conclude that the costs of strategic behavior created by electoral institutions have important consequences for electoral outcomes.},

Specifically, our results suggest that in addition to candidates' competitiveness, the decision to withdraw is a function of candidates' closeness to their party and ability to raise their profile. At the same time, some of our results contradict the conventional wisdom regarding presidential nomination campaigns, as we find no evidence that media coverage or cash on hand directly affect the duration of a nomination candidacy.},

We show that the two are conceptually compatible, relying on Mohr's theory of organizational innovation. Then we develop and test a unified explanation of state lottery adoptions reflecting both internal and regional influences. The empirical results provide a great degree of support for Mohr's theory. For the empirical analysis, we rely on event history analysis, a form of pooled cross-sectional time series analysis, which we believe may be useful in a wide variety of subfields of political science. Event history analysis may be able to explain important forms of political behavior (by individuals, organizations, or governments) even if they occur only rarely.},

We answer these questions using a comprehensive cross-sectional database linking voter preferences to local policy outcomes in more than 2,000 midsize cities and a new panel covering cities in two states. Overall, our analysis paints an encouraging picture of democracy in the city: we document substantial variation in local fiscal policy outcomes and provide evidence that voter preferences help explain why cities adopt different policies. As they become more Democratic, cities increase their spending across a number of service areas. In addition, voter sentiment shapes the other side of the ledger, determining the level and precise mix of revenues on which cities rely. In short, we show that cities respond both to competitive pressures and the needs and wants of their constituents.},

Projects which focus either on empirical advances in the quantification of urban form or related phenomena like travel behavior are rarely conversant, leading to a fundamental disconnect between operationalizing the concept and modeling its effects. Here, I build on previous work in developing a new index of sprawl and examine changes in urban morphology at the metropolitan level in the United States from 2000 to 2010. I then illustrate face validity by outlining suggestive relationships between the index and associated environmental and housing outcomes, while comparing it with other commonly used measures. I find that sprawl continues into the twenty-first century, and that this proposed measure demonstrates initial face validity with respect to key environmental and housing outcomes. I conclude with a discussion of the results and suggestions for future research.},

Previous research, however, has relied on proxy measures of isolation, such as being a marginalized group member within a population. We re-examine the relationship between social isolation and survey participation using direct measures of social isolation derived from social network data; specifically, instrumental research and expressive friendship connections among faculty within academic departments. Using a reconceptualization of social isolation, we find that social network isolation is negatively associated with unit response. Among women (a numerical minority group within the organization), we further find that social group isolation (i.e., lacking instrumental network connections to men, the majority group in the organization) is negatively associated with survey participation. Finally, we show that some survey estimates are systematically biased due to nonparticipation from socially isolated people.},

Recent empirical findings illustrate cases when the linkage between nonresponse rates and nonresponse biases is absent. Despite this, professional standards continue to urge high response rates. Statistical expressions of nonresponse bias can be translated into causal models to guide hypotheses about when nonresponse causes bias. Alternative designs to measure nonresponse bias exist, providing different but incomplete information about the nature of the bias. A synthesis of research studies estimating nonresponse bias shows the bias often present. A logical question at this moment in history is what advantage probability sample surveys have if they suffer from high nonresponse rates. Since postsurvey adjustment for nonresponse requires auxiliary variables, the answer depends on the nature of the design and the quality of the auxiliary variables.},

The Slovenian Public Opinion (SPO) survey of November/December 1990 was used by the government of Slovenia to prepare for the plebiscite. Because the plebiscite counted as "YES voters" only those voters who attended and voted for independence (nonvoters counted as "NO voters"), "Don't Know" survey responses can be thought of as missing data-the true intention of the voter is unknown but must be either "YES" or "NO." An analysis of the survey data under the missing-at-random assumption for the missing responses provides remarkably accurate estimates of the eventual plebiscite outcome, substantially better than ad hoc methods and a nonignorable model that allows nonresponse to depend on the intended vote.},

  abstract = {I examine how courts condition the relationship between state-level public opinion and policy. The system of federalism in the United States allows federal and state courts to establish the types of policies that states are constitutionally allowed to implement. In particular, federal courts can set ``federal floors'' for policy, below which no states can go. State courts, in turn, can raise the level of this floor. Thus, both federal and state courts shape whether state policy can match the preferences of the median voter in a given state. Analyzing data on public opinion, judicial decisions, and state-level policy on the issue of abortion, from 1973 to 2012, I show that changes in the set of allowable abortion restrictions, according to the combined decisions of state and federal courts, significantly affect whether states implement majority-preferred policies. I also show that ignoring the influence of courts on the policymaking environment significantly affects the estimated level of policy congruence and thus conclusions about the scope of representation. These results demonstrate the importance of placing courts in the larger study of state-level representation.},

  abstract = {Does direct democracy strengthen popular control of public policy in the United States? A major challenge in evaluating policy representation is the measurement of state-level public opinion and public policy. Although recent studies of policy responsiveness and congruence have provided improved measures of public opinion using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) techniques, these analyses are limited by their static nature and cross-sectional design. Issue attitudes, unlike more general political orientations, often vary considerably over time. Unless the dynamics of issue-specific public opinion are appropriately incorporated into the analyses, tests of policy responsiveness and congruence may be misleading. Thus, we assess the degree of policy representation in direct democracy states regarding same-sex relationship recognition policies using dynamic models of policy adoption and congruence that employ dynamic MRP estimates of attitudes toward same-sex marriage. We find that direct democracy institutions increase both policy responsiveness and congruence with issue-specific public opinion.},

  abstract = {Latent class analysis is used to examine Philip Converse's propositions about political opinion and nonopinion in the American public. Data were taken from the 1956, 1958, 1960 and the 1972, 1974, 1976 American voter panel studies conducted by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. Results support Converse's black-and-white model of attitude stability which posits the existence of some stable opinion holders and a group of "nonopinion" respondents whose positions vary unpredictably over time. Rates of opinion holding in the population were estimated to range from a low of 19\% for the utilities and housing item, which was Converse's focus, to an atypical high of 59\% for the busing item in the second panel. Models allowing for true score change estimated that the number of true score changers was small. The nonopinion respondents were apparently responsive enough to item content that their aggregated responses reflected the climate of opinion among those whose attitudes were better crystallized. As Converse had concluded, there was relatively little overlap of "issue publics"-those who held opinions on one issue were not necessarily opinion holders on other questions. There were not consistent differences in education or political involvement between opinion holders and nonopinion respondents. Relationships of education and political involvement to opinion holding suggest that respondents hold stable opinions on those issues that have greatest personal relevance for them.},

Recent formal theory literature has contributed new insights into how parties choose platforms in countries with a continuum of heterogeneous districts. Meanwhile, increases in survey sample sizes and advances in empirical techniques have made it possible to characterize the distribution of preferences within and across electoral districts. This review addresses an emerging literature that builds on these new tools to explore the ways in which the geography of political preferences can help explain the parties that compete, the platforms and policies they choose, and even the rules under which they compete. Building on insights from economic and political geography, it pays special attention to electoral and policy biases that can emerge when there is an asymmetric distribution of preferences across districts.},

  abstract = {Universal suffrage is a cornerstone of democratic governance. As levels of criminal punishment have risen in the United States, however, an ever-larger number of citizens have lost the right to vote. The authors ask whether felon disenfranchisement constitutes a meaningful reversal of the extension of voting rights by considering its political impact. Data from legal sources, election studies, and inmate surveys are examined to consider two counterfactual conditions: (1) whether removing disenfranchisement restrictions alters the outcomes of past U.S. Senate and presidential elections, and (2) whether applying contemporary rates of disenfranchisement to prior elections affects their outcomes. Because felons are drawn disproportionately from the ranks of racial minorities and the poor, disenfranchisement laws tend to take more votes from Democratic than from Republican candidates. Analysis shows that felon disenfranchisement played a decisive role in U.S. Senate elections in recent years. Moreover, at least one Republican presidential victory would have been reversed if former felons had been allowed to vote, and at least one Democratic presidential victory would have been jeopardized had contemporary rates of disenfranchisement prevailed during that time.},

We theorize that governors' decisions to oppose the funding should depend on both political demands and the level of need in the state, though politics and need are often in tension. We find that governors' partisanship and the composition of the legislature have substantively meaningful effects on governors' decisions, but the level of need in the state exerts little effect on governors' decisions. This suggests that for high profile, highly politicized issues such as the Affordable Care Act, political considerations outweigh the needs of citizens and state economic conditions in gubernatorial decision making.},

  abstract = {The multiple streams model, developed by Kingdon in the United States (US), is being adapted increasingly to study European Union (EU) policymaking. This, however, is revealing a theoretical underdevelopment in some of its central components. The present paper considers several concerns. It seeks to develop the idea of policy entrepreneurship as a context-specific activity that gives substance to the claim that `ideas have their time'; it interprets the key notion of ambiguity, in the EU context, to mean institutional ambiguity; and it allows for spillovers between policy areas to be endogenous as well as exogenous. This affects the nature of the policy windows wherein policy entrepreneurship occurs. The adapted multiple streams model is used to analyse the 2005 EU sugar policy reform. Institutional ambiguity and endogenous spillovers are shown to create the conditions that enabled active policy entrepreneurship to lead, ultimately, to reform of this most resilient of policies.},

This initiative, along with similar developments both nationally and internationally, signals discontent with the dominance of gross domestic product growth as the dominant measure of societal progress and suggest that in some respects at least, concern with measuring quality of life is an idea whose time has come. This article seeks to explain how and why this issue has risen up the EU's political agenda through this initiative, drawing on Kingdon's (2011) multiple streams approach to agenda-setting and related contributions.},

  abstract = {Governance architectures are strategic and long-term institutional arrangements of international organizations exhibiting three features; namely, they address strategic and long-term problems in a holistic manner, they set substantive output-oriented goals, and they are implemented through combinations of old and new organizational structures within the international organization in question. The Lisbon Strategy is the most high-profile initiative of the European Union for economic governance of the last decade. Yet it is also one of the most neglected subjects of EU studies, probably because not being identified as an object of study on its own right. We define the Lisbon Strategy as a case of governance architecture, raising questions about its creation, evolution and impact at the national level. We tackle these questions by drawing on institutional theories about emergence and change of institutional arrangements and on the multiple streams model. We formulate a set of propositions and hypotheses to make sense of the creation, evolution and national impact of the Lisbon Strategy. We argue that institutional ambiguity is used strategically by coalitions at the EU and national level in (re-)defining its ideational and organizational elements.},

In all four, the moves towards further prohibition reflected international trends, with evidence of policy transfer and the virus-like spread of ideas which has shifted the way that tobacco is framed. However, there are notable differences in the development of policy in each territory. This reinforces conceptions of transfer in which the importation of policy is mediated by political systems. Differences in policy conditions, institutions and `windows of opportunity' mean that our conclusions on the role and influence of interest groups, institutions and agenda-setting vary by territory, even within a member state. This suggests that a focus on an `idea whose time has come' should be supplemented by careful analysis of the political context in which the idea was articulated and accepted.},

  abstract = {This article explains the relaunch of the European Union's (EU) economic reform agenda in 2010. After repeated delays during 2009, the European Commission scaled back its initial plan for a revived social dimension and instead proposed a strengthened governance architecture of economic surveillance. Using the multiple streams framework we argue that the new Europe 2020 strategy which emerged is a product of two overlapping policy windows which opened suddenly in the problem stream (the Greek sovereign debt crisis) and politics stream (shifting institutional dynamics). This created a window of opportunity for skilful policy entrepreneurs to `couple' the three streams by reframing the existing Lisbon Strategy as the EU's exit strategy from the crisis. The article contributes to understanding policy change under conditions of ambiguity by demonstrating the causal significance of key temporal and ideational dynamics: the timing of policy windows; access to information signals; and the role of policy entrepreneurs.},

  abstract = {The dynamics by which policy ideas rise and fall can be linked to the intimate interactions between discrete physical time dimensions, such as policy windows, and distinctive perceptions of time, particularly the connections made between past, present and future in the form of narratives. Kingdon describes how `an idea whose time has come' can be carried forward in the key policy change instrument of a policy window, but much remains to be understood about the dynamics of windows, including why they apparently open for a relatively short time period, and the significance of the legacy left by windows in terms of their ability to influence later events. The article seeks a greater understanding of these dynamics through an examination of the potentially vital role played by the construction of narratives. The case study is taken from the politically sensitive area of urban road pricing, in the form of the London Congestion Charge.},

  abstract = {This paper is a comparative analysis of the telecommunications policy-making process in China and India. Adopting an institutionalist perspective and multi-streams framework, the paper analyzes the formal structures, rule-making procedures and interest groups involved in telecommunications policy-making in the two countries, in terms of their evolution over the last two decades. Though the two systems began this period with a somewhat similar ministerial-bureaucratic decision-making model, and faced similar problems of assimilating new interest groups and responding to international pressures, the paper finds that the decision systems in the two countries evolved in significantly different directions. China's telecommunications decision-making is significantly affected by the macro level political rearrangement and is more likely to be non-incremental. On the other hand, confronted by an increasingly litigious environment and a more fractious interest group culture, India represents a somewhat classical textbook case of incremental policy making. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain in both countries, including institutional capacity and excessive regulatory deference to political authority.},

Situating the article within the literature on agenda-setting and framing, it is argued that a policy window was opened as a result of: enlargement to include more energy import dependent states, a trend of increasing energy imports and prices, and gas supply disruptions. From the mid-2000s, the Commission contributed to a shift in political norms, successfully framing import dependency as a problem requiring an EU-level solution, based on the institution's pre-existing preferences for a diversified energy supply and internal energy market. Whilst Member States retain significant sovereignty, the Commission has achieved since 2006 creeping competencies in the internal, and to a lesser extent external, dimensions of EU energy policy.},

Europeanization's success, i.e., its effectiveness and democratic accountability, is hypothesized to vary according to a program's level of ambiguity and complexity. Four types of Europeanization are identified and explored: administrative, adversarial, interpretative, and experimental. The model improves on arguments regarding Europeanization by identifying the conditions under which top-down and bottom-up approaches are appropriate, by rectifying the fallacy of delegation and control, and by identifying important value trade-offs in European integration.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a model of the decision-making process that can help to understand the politics of policy change and stability. The model takes as a starting point veto players. Since these actors are mostly political parties in Western democracies, their preferences can be modelled as policy seeking and vote maximization. Thus, governing parties try to adopt certain policies which differ according to their partisan orientation. The adoption of policies may, however, be impeded by electoral considerations unless the government is confronted with economic problems that put its re-election at risk. In addition, the existence of further veto players can make the adoption of reforms difficult. Policy change comes about if at least one element of the veto player constellation changes or if an external shock occurs. Both of these mechanisms are discussed in more detail, taking a change in the partisan complexion of government and globalization as examples.},

Little Brown, Boston] ``multiple streams'' framework to analyse the sudden move from overgenerous grandfathering to tight caps and auctioning within the German emissions trading regime in the first half of 2007. By bringing together empirical evidence from interviews and official documents the following question is addressed: how completely does Kingdon's framework explain this political turn? The opening of a ``policy window'' can be demonstrated and Kingdon's theory concisely captures important aspects of this process. At the same time, however, the findings imply that a number of relevant factors are not sufficiently considered by the theory, most notably the influence of multi-level governance structures, learning processes, and networks. This demonstrates that the multiple streams approach on its own is not sufficient to fully understand the case study example. Hence, for a better understanding of policy change it is suggested that scholars need to evaluate the potential for amending and combining Kingdon's model with other explanatory approaches.},

  shorttitle = {Opening the Policy Window for Ecological Economics},
  abstract = {Ecological economics and its allied trans-disciplinary fields are well established in academia, but so far have failed to have significant influence on policy makers. Public policy research and theory suggest that three process streams must converge in order to shape the political agenda and change policy [Kingdon, J. 1984. Agenda, Alternatives, and Public Policies. Boston: Little, Brown.]. First, the ``problem'' stream emerges when an existing condition is defined as a problem \textendash{} a discrepancy between current reality and a desired goal \textendash{} and critical policy makers accept the definition of the problem. The ``policy'' stream emerges as consensus grows around policy instruments to solve the problem. The ``politics'' stream emerges as the ``national mood'' and leading politicians accept the gravity of the problem and are willing to implement the policies required to address it. When these three streams converge, a policy window is created that can move issues onto the political agenda and into formal policy. A focusing event, like Katrina, can bring these three process streams together. However, different strategic representations of the situation may allow entirely different problem definitions and policies to dominate the political agenda. This paper analyzes the extent to which Katrina has opened a policy window for ecological economics. We find that Katrina has strengthened the three streams necessary to create a policy window for ecological economics, but that the dominant economic paradigm currently on the political agenda \textendash{} market fundamentalism \textendash{} is strategically presenting Katrina as supporting its own problem stream and policy stream. Key elements of the ecological economic agenda, such as investing in natural capital, are making it on to the political agenda, but overall market fundamentalist policies appear likely to dominate. We argue that ecological economists have failed to galvanize public acceptance for the policy goals of sustainable scale and just distribution, thus failing to effectively communicate their perspectives on problem definition and/or policy solutions to policy makers and the voting public. We conclude with suggestions for how ecological economists can still take advantage of the Katrina window, and better prepare for future windows opening. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Schattschneider wrote that the high abstention and large differences between the rates of electoral participation of richer and poorer citizens found in the United States were caused by high levels of economic inequality. Despite increasing inequality and stagnant or declining voting rates since then, Schattschneider's hypothesis remains largely untested. This article takes advantage of the variation in inequality across states and over time to remedy this oversight. Using a multilevel analysis that combines aspects of state context with individual survey responses in 144 gubernatorial elections, it finds that citizens of states with greater income inequality are less likely to vote and that income inequality increases income bias in the electorate, lending empirical support to Schattschneider's argument.},

Using time-series data from 1914 to 2010, we assess the effect of partisan politics on financial deregulation and, in turn, the effect of deregulation on income inequality. We find that financial deregulation has generally declined when Democrats attain more power in Washington and that deregulation has contributed to rising inequality. We also learn that the partisan effect on deregulation has diminished since the early 1980s, suggesting that one way partisan politics has contributed to the recent rise in inequality is related to convergence on matters of financial deregulation. We explore several potential explanations for this post\textendash{}1980 partisan convergence, finding evidence supporting the idea that globalization, the increasing availability of credit, and shifts in campaign finance were contributing factors.},

  abstract = {Understanding how the Tea Party has affected congressional elections and roll call voting helps us understand not only an important political movement, but how movements affect politics more generally.We investigate four channels for the movement to influence political outcomes: activists, constituent opinion, group endorsement activity and elite-level self-identification. We find consistent evidence that activists mattered both electorally and for roll call voting on issues of importance to the movement. Constituent opinion had virtually no impact on either political outcome. Group endorsement activity had possible effects on elections, but mostly no effect on congressional voting. Self-identification among elites did not enhance\textemdash{}or harm\textemdash{}Republican electoral fortunes, but did affect congressional votes important to the movement.These divergent results illustrate how movement politics can influence outcomes through multiple channels and call into question the usefulness of the ``Tea Party'' moniker without important qualifiers.},

  abstract = {What explains the dynamic movement in the gender gap in public opinion toward government activism over the past 30 years? The thermostatic model of politics suggests that aggregate public opinion adjusts to liberal changes in public policy by preferring less government and to conservative changes in policy by preferring more government. Given the cross-sectional differences in policy preferences between men and women, we argue that the dynamic movement in the gender gap in policy preferences for more or less government spending is a function of asymmetrical responses by men and women to changes in public policy. We find that both men and women respond to changes in public policy by shifting their policy preferences in the same direction. But men appear more responsive to policy changes than do women. It is this asymmetrical response to changes in public policy that is responsible for the dynamics of the gender gap in policy preferences across time. Our results show that the gap increases when policy moves in a liberal direction, as men move in a conservative direction at a faster rate than women. In contrast, when policy moves to the right, the opinions of both men and women will respond by moving to the left, but the greater responsiveness among men will decrease the gap, bringing male preferences closer to the preferences of women.},

Studies focused on a small number of reforms, years, or states lack the scope necessary to comprehensively evaluate the effects of institutional change over time. This work, however, places recent reforms in historical context and offers a long-term perspective. Using an original data set, it identifies the institutions that have generated the most substantial effects on state turnout rates during presidential elections from 1920 to 2000. Findings demonstrate that restrictive laws (those aiming to limit the vote or make voting more costly) produced large and consistently negative effects in the Southern and non-Southern states alike, but the effects associated with expansive reforms (those making participation more convenient or less costly) vary. Although a few expansive laws have increased turnout in the non-Southern states, they have had no effect in the Southern states where turnout rates are lowest.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore whether, in the U.S., there are associations between state-level variations in mortality among young children and state abortion restriction policies e such as parental-consent requirements, parental-notification requirements, mandatory delay laws, and restrictions on Medicaid funding for abortion. To investigate this, we used NCHS Multiple Cause of Deaths public-use data files for the period 1983e2002, and compiled data on children ages 0e4 identified as having died as a result of assault/homicide in each state and year. Medicaid funding of abortion, mandatory delay laws, and parental involvement laws for minors seeking abortions were included as the main predictor variables of interest. Multivariate count data models using pooled state-year-age cohort data, with state and time fixed effects and other state-level controls, were estimated. Results indicated that, between 1983 and 2002, the average increase in the number of homicide deaths for children under 5 years of age was 5.70 per state among states that implemented stricter abortion policies over that time, and 2.00 per state for states that did not. In the count data models, parental-consent laws were associated with a 13 percent increase in child homicide deaths; parental-notification laws were associated with an 8 percent increase in child homicide deaths though the results were less robust to alternate model specifications; mandatory delay requirements were associated with a 13 percent increase in child homicide deaths. While these data do not allow us to discern precise pathways via which state abortionrestrictions can lead to more child homicide deaths, we speculate that state restrictions on abortion may result in a disproportionate increase in children born into relatively high-risk environments. Additional research is called for to explore the association of state abortion-restrictions with other measures of infant/child health and well-being.},

I argue that, by adapting organizational theory to account for the particular function of interest organizations, scholars can build a widely applied theoretical framework. The key step is an analysis of the role that organizations play in the mobilization of influence: they are intermediaries, reliant on their constituents and their lobbying targets. Reviewing research on ethnic politics and political economy, I demonstrate that this intermediary view of interest organizations encourages theoretical ideas to travel between subfields.},

  abstract = {In January 2010, the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. FEC overturned long-standing regulations governing the role of unions and corporations in sponsoring pro-candidate advocacy. Many predicted a deleterious effect on the electoral process. In the aftermath of the midterm elections, a number of questions deserve consideration. Was the observed level of outside spending abnormally high in 2010? What can we say about the potential effect of outside spending on the outcomes of House and Senate races? Moreover, what has the decision done to the power of parties and, most especially, their ability to compete with special interests in backing federal candidates? This paper investigates these questions using data from the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracked political ads in 2010. The initial evidence suggests that while interest groups were aggressive players in the air war, their impact may not have been as negative or as large as initially predicted.},

  abstract = {Is public policy in states that allow initiatives and referenda more responsive to public opinion than in states that do not? Political science theory provides conflicting answers to this question. On one hand, these direct democracy mechanisms give citizens a direct voice in public policy, which may directly and indirectly shape policy to their wishes. On the other hand, formal theories of collective choice call into question the ability of direct democracy to produce policy that reflects the underlying distribution of mass preferences. This study tests these competing hypotheses by assessing the impact of public opinion on abortion policy using a new survey-based measure of state-level abortion attitudes (Brace et al. 2002). The empirical findings indicate that states with initiatives and referenda are more responsive to public opinion on abortion policy.},

@article{farina_congressional_2015,
  title = {Congressional {{Polarization}}: {{Terminal Constitutional Dysfuction}}},
  volume = {115},
  abstract = {Political polarization has become a major focus in contemporary discussions on congressional activity and governance. The tone of these discussions has grown increasingly grim, as many political scientists argue that a constitutional system of divided and shared powers
hardens current levels of partisan warfare into legislative gridlock. Proposals for reform abound. Scholars and political commentators have called for modifications to the electoral process and to party structure, for additional oversight of the culture among members of Congress, and for increased attention to demographics and economic inequality within the electorate. These proposals sometimes conflict, and usually face
daunting legal or political obstacles to adoption.
In an effort to better assess the likelihood that congressional dysfunction will be the norm going forward, this Essay reviews and synthesizes recent political science literature with the goal of sorting out
what we know-and, perhaps more important, do not know-about the
nature, extent, and causes of  congressional polarization. The Essay begins by discussing standard metrics of congressional polarization and describing
alternative approaches that challenge the standard account as overly simplistic. It then looks at historical trends to consider whether the contemporary situation is truly anomalous. Next, it considers the many theories put forth to explain the phenomenon, focusing initially on whether congressional polarization can be explained by polarization in the electorate and then moving to proposals around the electoral process, party structure and culture, and demographics. Finding little support in the literature for
the notion that the challenged structures and practices are actually driving
legislative polarization, the Essay concludes by suggesting that the rhetoric
around congressional polarization-particularly around the likely continuation of partisan warfare and legislative gridlock-is far more negative than the existing evidence can justify.},

If one examines the data without resort to multiple recodings and aggregations, their case disappears. Regarding geographic polarization, Abramowitz and Saunders argue that we have understated its extent and that such polarization is increasing. We continue to believe that the red-blue divide is a misleading exaggeration, and we note that recent research on changes in geographic polarization indicates that they are wrong. Regarding religious polarization, Abramowitz and Saunders claim that our claim that economic differences are deeper than religious differences is wrong. We made no such claim, and again, recent research indicates that their claim is wrong. Finally, Abramowitz and Saunders argue that polarization enhances citizen engagement.},

Congress and some newer media outlets have added more partisan messages to a continuing supply of mostly centrist news. Although political attitudes of most Americans have remained fairly moderate, evidence points to some polarization among the politically involved. Proliferation of media choices lowered the share of less interested, less partisan voters and thereby made elections more partisan. But evidence for a causal link between more partisan messages and changing attitudes or behaviors is mixed at best. Measurement problems hold back research on partisan selective exposure and its consequences. Ideologically one-sided news exposure may be largely confined to a small, but highly involved and influential, segment of the population. There is no firm evidence that partisan media are making ordinary Americans more partisan.},

The most direct evidence\textemdash{}citizens' positions on public policy issues\textemdash{}shows little or no indication of increased mass polarization over the past two to three decades. Party sorting\textemdash{}an increased correlation between policy views and partisan identification\textemdash{}clearly has occurred, although the extent has sometimes been exaggerated. Geographic polarization\textemdash{}the hypothesized tendency of like-minded people to cluster together\textemdash{}remains an open question.

Two dimension of issue responsibility are assessed: causal responsibility focuses on the origins of the issue, while treatment responsibility focuses on alleviation of the issue. THe model is tested with a sample of four issues: poverty, racial inequality, crim, and terrorism. THe restults indicate that for all four issues attributions of responsibility significantly affect issue opinoins independently of partisanship, liberl-conservative orientation, information, and socioeconomic status. In general, agents of causal responsibility are viewed negatively while agents of treatment responsibility are viewed positively. In conclusion, the importance of domain-specificity for public opinion research is considered.},

the other hand, a spiral of conviction seems to make it difficult for the highly
informed few to see any aspects of politics but those that confirm the cognitive structures that organize their political perceptions.This is a troubling situation for any consequentialist democratic political theory, according to which what is crucial is the electorate's (and subsidiary decision makers') ability to make informed policy judgments, not their possession of willful but uninformed political ``attitudes.''

end in itself (regardless of its consequences) should be concerned about Converse's findings.},

These dimensions-identification, discontent, withdrawal of legitimacy, and collective orientation-were applied to the gender consciousness of women. In all but one of these dimensions, women's gender consciousness was comparatively weak. It was not as pronounced as the group consciousness of other subordinate categories, nor was it distinctly subordinate because men expressed similar views. A structural interpretation of this comparative weakness is offered. Women did become more group conscious between 1972 and 1983. The increase was particularly pronounced with regard to their discontent about the relative political power of men and women and their views about the legitimacy of gender disparities.},

On the basis of their identity in racial/ethnic identity groups, minority women operate as both racial/ethnic minorities and women in the American polity. As such, the analysis models intersectionality to account for historical narratives, cultural representations, and legal discrimination to show how both race/ethnicity and gender operate in tandem to influence how minority women participate in American politics.},

We found that women presidential candidates were viewed as significantly less qualified to be president when compared to male candidates with similar credentials. Although results showed that Democratic women candidates were not at a disadvantage in hypothetical primary nominee match-ups, evidence of gender bias appeared in general election match-ups. Candidates who were men beat the women candidates in every general election matchup, and what is more, voters frequently switched their votes to the candidate who was a man when the opposition candidate was a woman. Implications for women running for president are discussed.},

Using an unobtrusive measure called the "list experiment," we find that public opinion polls are indeed exaggerating support for a female president. Roughly 26 percent of the public is "angry or upset" about the prospect of a female president. Moreover, this level of dissatisfaction is constant across several demographic groups.},

In this article, we argue that the violent group itself, and the identity it bestows on participating members, is an often overlooked and yet fundamental source of motivation for an individual's participation in collective violence. Reviewing insights from social and moral psychology, military history, and public health, we outline how the psychology of individual violent behavior presents a puzzle. For an ordinary person, participation in violence is often an aversive and distressing experience, and yet violent behavior leads to more violence in the future. A better understanding of the dynamics of collective violence allows us to make sense of this paradox. Violent groups can promote violent behavior among members by increasing members' motivation to engage in violence, particularly through group identification and deliberate strategies, and by removing psychological obstacles to violence (i.e., by making violence less aversive). Our synthesis of the literature points to a cycle of individuals' participation in collective violence, in which group identification motivates violent behavior and violent behavior increases identification with violent groups.},

Results by and large confirmed our predictions that perceived threat would be directly associated with poorer well-being but would also exert a positive indirect effect on well-being via increased social identification. However, these relationships were dependent on individuals' prior conflict exposure, such that the positive indirect relationship between perceived threat and psychological well-being emerged only for two subpopulations: individuals who had high direct and high indirect exposure to conflict, and individuals who had low direct, but high indirect conflict exposure. No indirect effects emerged for individuals with relatively lower conflict exposure.

Yet, the unavoidably partisan nature of political conflict has had too little influence on scholarship on political psychology. Despite more than 50 years of research on political parties and citizens, we continue to lack a systematic understanding of when and how political parties influence public opinion. We suggest that alternative approaches to political parties and public opinion can be best reconciled and examined through a richer theoretical perspective grounded in motivated reasoning theory. Clearly, parties shape citizens' opinions by mobilizing, influencing, and structuring choices among political alternatives. But the answer to when and how parties influence citizens' reasoning and political opinions depends on an interaction between citizens' motivations, effort, and information generated from the political environment (particularly through competition between parties). The contribution of motivated reasoning, as we describe it, is to provide a coherent theoretical framework for understanding partisan influence on citizens' political opinions. We review recent empirical work consistent with this framework. We also point out puzzles ripe for future research and discuss how partisanmotivated reasoning provides a useful point of departure for such work.},

While some worry that people increasingly are seeking out likeminded views, others propose that newer media provide an increased opportunity for exposure to diverse views. In returning to the concept of selective exposure, this article argues that certain topics, such as politics, are more likely to inspire selective exposure and that research should investigate habitual media exposure patterns, as opposed to single exposure decisions. This study investigates whether different media types (newspapers, political talk radio, cable news, and Internet) are more likely to inspire selective exposure. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, evidence supports the idea that people's political beliefs are related to their media exposure - a pattern that persists across media types. Over-time analyses suggest that people's political beliefs motivate their media use patterns and that cable news audiences became increasingly politically divided over the course of the 2004 election.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the effect of racial cues on candidate perception and evaluation. In an experimental setting, we manipulated the race of a hypothetical candidate. Our causal model then examines how the candidate's race influences voters through stereotyping biases as well as the more "affect-laden" impact of racial prejudice. The experimental design affords many advantages over traditional survey research because we possess (1) complete control over the policy stands taken by the candidate and (2) an ability to eliminate confounds among the explanatory variables. We conclude by noting the pervasive influence of cognitive and affective expectations on black candidate perception and evaluation, and how these psychological biases might inhibit the formation of a "nonracial, middle-of-the-road" campaign by black candidates. Additionally, we note limitations of the experiment design and propose an agenda for future research.},

  abstract = {A growing body of research shows that Barack Obama's rise to prominence has further polarized mass politics by racial attitudes and race\textemdash{}a phenomenon we have described elsewhere as the spillover of racialization. There is still much that remains unknown about source-cue spillover effects in general and the spillover of racialization in particular. This study helps fill that void by drawing on prior research in political psychology and several new empirical examples to address lingering questions that have not been adequately answered. Those new empirical analyses suggest that issues that are already strongly influenced by racial attitudes, issues that the public has strong opinions about, and issues where Obama cross-pressures Americans with racially conservative positions are all less likely to racialize in response to the president's visible positions. I also show that low-information Americans and Democrats are most susceptible to racial spillover effects. Finally, the extant evidence suggests that the source-cue spillover effects can have lasting impacts on public opinion and that the races, religions, and genders of other prominent elite sources can also activate group-based considerations in mass opinion formation.},

  abstract = {This paper develops an econometric technique to test for political bias in news reports that controls for the underlying character of the news reported. Because of the changing availability of the number of newspapers in Nexis/Lexis, two sets of time are examined: from January 1991 to May 2004 and from January 1985 to May 2004. Our results suggest that American newspapers tend to give more positive coverage to the same economic news when Democrats are in the White House than when Republicans are; a similar though smaller effect is found for Democratic control of Congress. Our results reject the claim that ``reader diversity is a powerful force toward accuracy.'' When all types of news are pooled into a single analysis, our results are significant. However, the results vary greatly depending upon which types of economic data are being reported. When newspapers are examined individually the only support that Republicans appear to obtain is from the president's home state newspapers during his term. This is true for the Houston Chronicle under both Bushes and the Los Angeles Times during the Reagan administration. Contrary to rational expectations, media coverage affects people's perceptions of the economy.},

  abstract = {In the American political process, news discourse concerning public policy issues is carefully constructed. This occurs in part because both politicians and interest groups take an increasingly proactive approach to amplify their views of what an issue is about. However, news media also play an active role in framing public policy issues. Thus, in this article, news discourse is conceived as a sociocognitive process involving all three players: sources, journalists, and audience members operating in the universe of shared culture and on the basis of socially defined roles. Framing analysis is presented as a constructivist approach to examine news discourse with the primary focus on conceptualizing news texts into empirically operationalizable dimensions\textemdash{}syntactical, script, thematic, and rhetorical structures\textemdash{}so that evidence of the news media's framing of issues in news texts may be gathered. This is considered an initial step toward analyzing the news discourse process as a whole. Finally, an extended empirical example is provided to illustrate the applications of this conceptual framework of news texts.},

  abstract = {In this paper I identify whether budgets in Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are punctuated and investigate the variation in budget punctuations over time. Building on stochastic process methods, I find that budgets in all four cases exhibit mostly incremental changes punctuated by extreme shifts. In order to explain variation in budget punctuations over time, I rely on two models: partisan control of government and partisan distance of the assembly. The two models are tested using national budgetary data across all government functions for the four countries from the mid-1960s to 1989. I find that greater distance in strength and ideology among parties leads to increases in the degree of punctuations in the German and the British cases, whereas there is some evidence for the partisan control model in the American cases. In the Danish cases, partisan distance reduces the degree of budget punctuations.},

  abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive analysis of stability and punctuations in public spending within and across two different countries-Denmark and the United States. The theoretical starting point is the classic model of budget incrementalism and Jones and Baumgartner's model of disproportionate information processing. First, despite the clear differences in institutional setup, we show that public spending spanning many decades in Denmark and the United States are characterized by a similar distribution of small-, medium-, and large-scale spending changes. What is more intriguing is that we show how this aggregate result obscures (1) substantial variation between categories of public spending and (2) similar tendencies within similar spending categories across the two countries. These findings suggest that we need to unpack the overall budgets for detecting the particular sources of stability and change in government spending. Hence, the article offers important comparative findings that not only challenge the empirical validity of classic budgetary incrementalism but also advocate an increased focus on more disaggregated spending dynamics than employed in previous studies of the model of disproportionate information processing.},

  abstract = {In this article, we review two research programs that could benefit from a more extensive dialogue: media and policy studies of agenda setting. We focus on three key distinctions that divide these two robust research programs: the agenda(s) under investigation (public versus policymaking), the typical level of analysis (individual versus systemic), and framing effects (individual versus macro level). We map out these differences and their impacts on understanding the policy process. There is often a policy disconnect in the agenda-setting studies that emanate from the media tradition. Though interested in the effects of political communication, scholars from this tradition often fail to link the media to policy outcomes, policy change, or agenda change. Policy process scholars have increasingly rejected simple linear models in favor of models emphasizing complex feedback effects. This suggests a different role for the media\textemdash{}one of highlighting attributes in a multifaceted political reality and involvement in positive feedback cycles. Yet, political communication scholars have for the most part been insensitive to these potentials. We advocate a shared agenda centering on the role of the media in the political system from an information processing framework, emphasizing the reciprocal effects of each on the other.},

We report the results of a field experiment on U.S. state legislators in which the nativity, likelihood of voting, and race/ethnicity of a hypothetical constituent are independently manipulated. The experimental design allows us to contribute new insights by isolating the various elements that may impede the connection between immigrants and elected representatives. Moreover, we explore racial/ethnic identities beyond black and white by including Latino and Asian aliases. Contrary to expectations, nativity and voting status do not affect response rates. Instead, legislator behavior appears to be driven by racial/ ethnic bias. Whites benefit from the highest response rate, while blacks, Hispanics, and Asians all receive lower rates, respectively. This bias follows a partisan logic. The low response rate for Hispanic constituents comes primarily from Republican legislators, whereas Asians experience bias from representatives of both parties. We argue that this difference may result from Hispanic identity sending a stronger signal about partisan affiliation, or from a prejudicial view of Asians as outsiders. In this last interpretation, rather than the model minority, Asians become the excluded minority.},

A growing body of evidence suggests that lawmakers are more responsive to the rich when they craft policy. However, some scholars theorize that officials also exhibit a corresponding bias in favor of the poor
when they handle casework, essentially giving policy to the rich and services to the poor. In this paper, we test this casework prediction using four experiments in which confederates sent simple requests to state or local officials. In each, our confederates' reported social classes were randomly assigned and signaled with a brief introductory statement mentioning the sender's occupation or economic situation. Across our samples, we find precisely-estimated null effects of social class biases: the officials we studied were equally likely to respond regardless of the constituent's class. These findings raise doubts about whether casework is really a class-biased process.},

It shows that existing policies feed back into the political system, shaping subsequent policy outcomes. Policies exert this effect by altering not only the capacities, interests, and beliefs of political elites and states but also those of the public. Public policies can shape political participation and attitudes. These effects can be positive or negative, enhancing or undercutting participation and conferring positive or negative messages about individuals' worth as citizens. These effects originate in elements of program design, such as the size, visibility, and traceability of benefits, the proximity of beneficiaries, and modes of program administration. Thus, public policy itself shapes the distance of citizens from government, with profound implications for democratic governance.},

In contrast to prior findings, public housing officials respond at equal rates to black and white email requests. We do, however, find limited evidence of responsiveness discrimination toward Hispanics. Moreover, we observe substantial differences in email tone. Hispanic housing applicants were 20 percentage points less likely to be greeted by name than were their black and white counterparts. This disparity in tone is somewhat more muted in more diverse locations, but it does not depend on whether a housing official is Hispanic.},

Analyzing four separate, nationallyrepresentative surveys from 2007 to 2016, I show that a reliable asymmetry among partisans exists regarding their preference for political leaders who compromise. Among persons with right-leaning identities, high levels of overlap between partisanship and ideology undercut the professed desirability of compromise and amplify the association between compromise and selling out one's principles. However, when individuals are asked about the specific extent to which one's ``side'' deserves greater deference in the policymaking process, differences between persons with left- and right-leaning identities disappear. Well-sorted individuals are uniformly unwilling to distribute policymaking demands equally. Although this disconnect is emblematic of the general tension between abstract principles and episodic behavior (or ``practicing what you preach''), it also highlights how the introduction of material threat may challenge expressive commitments to lofty ideals.},

Advancing hypotheses informed by affective intelligence theory, we use two data sets from the American National Election Studies to examine the conditions under which disagreeable discussion is consistent with different models of political discussion. Our findings are twofold. First, overall we find mixed evidence to support information seeking motives. Disagreeable discussion\textemdash{}regardless of conceptualization and operationalization\textemdash{}is poorly predicted by emotions associated with information seeking (e.g., fear), while it is better structured by emotions associated with expression and participation (e.g., enthusiasm). Second, leveraging available temporal information, we find evidence that, although only suggestive, is consistent with emotion leading to disagreeable discussion (rather than disagreement leading to emotion). We discuss the utility and limitations of using emotion to examine interpersonal discussion networks, situating our effort in a broader research agenda on social influence.},

The focus is on latent variable models, given their growing use in theory testing and construction. Theoretical statistical results in regression are discussed, and more important issues are illustrated with novel simulations involving latent variable models including factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and factor mixture models. Asymptotically, the BIC is consistent, in that it will select the true model if, among other assumptions, the true model is among the candidate models considered. The AIC is not consistent under these circumstances. When the true model is not in the candidate model set the AIC is efficient, in that it will asymptotically choose whichever model minimizes the mean squared error of prediction/estimation. The BIC is not efficient under these circumstances. Unlike the BIC, the AIC also has a minimax property, in that it can minimize the maximum possible risk in finite sample sizes. In sum, the AIC and BIC have quite different properties that require different assumptions, and applied researchers and methodologists alike will benefit from improved understanding of the asymptotic and finite-sample behavior of these criteria. The ultimate decision to use the AIC or BIC depends on many factors, including the loss function employed, the study's methodological design, the substantive research question, and the notion of a true model and its applicability to the study at hand.},

In model selection, it is well known that BIC is consistent in selecting the true model, and AIC is minimax-rate optimal for estimating the regression function. A recent promising direction is adaptive model selection, in which, in contrast to AIC and BIC, the penalty term is data-dependent. Some theoretical and empirical results have been obtained in support of adaptive model selection, but it is still not clear if it can really share the strengths of AIC and BIC. Model combining or averaging has attracted increasing attention as a means to overcome the model selection uncertainty. Can Bayesian model averaging be optimal for estimating the regression function in a minimax sense? We show that the answers to these questions are basically in the negative: for any model selection criterion to be consistent, it must behave suboptimally for estimating the regression function in terms of minimax rate of covergence; and Bayesian model averaging cannot be minimax-rate optimal for regression estimation.},

  shorttitle = {An Algorithm for Removing Sensitive Information},
  abstract = {Predictive modeling is increasingly being employed to assist human decision-makers. One purported advantage of replacing or augmenting human judgment with computer models in high stakes settings\textendash{} such as sentencing, hiring, policing, college admissions, and parole decisions\textendash{}is the perceived ``neutrality'' of computers. It is argued that because computer models do not hold personal prejudice, the predictions they produce will be equally free from prejudice. There is growing recognition that employing algorithms does not remove the potential for bias, and can even amplify it if the training data were generated by a process that is itself biased. In this paper, we provide a probabilistic notion of algorithmic bias. We propose a method to eliminate bias from predictive models by removing all information regarding protected variables from the data to which the models will ultimately be trained. Unlike previous work in this area, our framework is general enough to accommodate data on any measurement scale. Motivated by models currently in use in the criminal justice system that inform decisions on pre-trial release and parole, we apply our proposed method to a dataset on the criminal histories of individuals at the time of sentencing to produce ``race-neutral'' predictions of re-arrest. In the process, we demonstrate that a common approach to creating ``race-neutral'' models\textendash{} omitting race as a covariate\textendash{} still results in racially disparate predictions. We then demonstrate that the application of our proposed method to these data removes racial disparities from predictions with minimal impact on predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {There has been substantial recent interest in record linkage, attempting to group the records pertaining to the same entities from a large database lacking unique identifiers. This can be viewed as a type of ``microclustering,'' with few observations per cluster and a very large number of clusters. A variety of methods have been proposed, but there is a lack of literature providing theoretical guarantees on performance. We show that the problem is fundamentally hard from a theoretical perspective, and even in idealized cases, accurate entity resolution is effectively impossible when the number of entities is small relative to the number of records and/or the separation among records from different entities is not extremely large. To characterize the fundamental difficulty, we focus on entity resolution based on multivariate Gaussian mixture models, but our conclusions apply broadly and are supported by simulation studies inspired by human rights applications. These results suggest conservatism in interpretation of the results of record linkage, support collection of additional data to more accurately disambiguate the entities, and motivate a focus on coarser inference. For example, results from a simulation study suggest that sometimes one may obtain accurate results for population size estimation even when fine scale entity resolution is inaccurate.},

  abstract = {There are three basic types of trading area analysis models that can be used to assess new store location and trade areas potential: analog, regression, and gravity. Gravity models tend to be popular and primarily include Reilly's Law of Retail Gravitation, Converse's Breaking-Point Model, Huff's Model of Trade Area Attraction and Christaller's Central Place Theory. Arguably the most popular of theses gravity models and methods is Converse's Breaking-Point Model which was based on Reilly's Law of Retail Gravitation which first appeared in 1929 as a research monograph at the University of Texas, Austin and was subsequently widely distributed in book form in 1931. Of primary research importance is the observation that a literature and textbook review of the application of the Converse Breaking-Point Model produces mixed results in terms of visually confirmable trade area calculations. This may be based on the further observation that the ratio in the formula's denominator should be reversed with corresponding inverse distance and trade area break-point applications. The authors' revision of the widely applied Converse Breaking-Point Model is therefore proposed on the basis of changed retail patterns from the original 1931 derivation of Reilly's Law due to the decentralization of retail shopping areas and greatly improved shopper mobility in more rural and suburban shopping areas. Reilly's original Law of Retail Gravitation is reviewed in addition to the Converse Breaking-Point Model with revised formulae logic and applications identified.},

Thousands of measurements are available nowadays in operations where previously only a single measurement, at a given point in time or space, was taken. These measurements allow the reconstruction of the whole profile or "signature" of the operation over time or space. Examples are the tonnage applied in a stamping press during a stroke and the density profile of particleboard. Many of these signatures have complicated forms that are not well modeled with parametric models. In this paper, a relatively new class of models called additive models is used to assess the sources of variation active on these signatures. The model contains a nonparametric or smooth portion to model the form of the signature, and a parametric portion to evaluate other sources of variation. An analysis of variance table is developed to test the magnitude of sources of variation. These techniques are illustrated using density profiles of engineered wood boards. Instructions on the implementation of these techniques in S-Plus and SAS are given.},

We use these results to predict the decline in friendship segregation that would occur if across- and within-school residential segregation were eliminated in U.S. metropolitan areas. The results suggest that about a third of the level of racial friendship segregation in schools is attributable to residential segregation. Most of this effect is due to geographic segregation across schools rather than residential segregation within schools.},

  abstract = {Local polynomial fitting for univariate data has been widely studied and discussed, but up until now the multivariate equivalent has often been deemed impractical, due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. Here, rather than discounting it completely, we use density as a threshold to determine where over a data range reliable multivariate smoothing is possible, whilst accepting that in large areas it is not. The merits of a density threshold derived from the asymptotic influence function are shown using both real and simulated data sets. Further, the challenging issue of multivariate bandwidth selection, which is known to be affected detrimentally by sparse data which inevitably arise in higher dimensions, is considered. In an effort to alleviate this problem, two adaptations to generalized cross-validation are implemented, and a simulation study is presented to support the proposed method. It is also discussed how the density threshold and the adapted generalized cross-validation technique introduced herein work neatly together.},

One of the promises of this field is linking abundances of microbial taxa to phenotypic and physiological states, which can inform development of new diagnostic, personalized medicine, and forensic modalities. Prior research has demonstrated the feasibility of applying machine learning methods to perform body site and subject classification with microbiomic data. However, it is currently unknown which classifiers perform best among the many available alternatives for classification with microbiomic data.
Results: In this work, we performed a systematic comparison of 18 major classification methods, 5 feature selection methods, and 2 accuracy metrics using 8 datasets spanning 1,802 human samples and various classification tasks: body site and subject classification and diagnosis.
Conclusions: We found that random forests, support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, and Bayesian logistic regression with Laplace priors are the most effective machine learning techniques for performing accurate classification from these microbiomic data.},

  volume = {4},
  issn = {1471-2288},
  abstract = {Background: Consider a meta-analysis where a 'head-to-head' comparison of diagnostic tests for a disease of interest is intended. Assume there are two or more tests available for the disease, where each test has been studied in one or more papers. Some of the papers may have studied more than one test, hence the results are not independent. Also the collection of tests studied may change from one paper to the other, hence incomplete matched groups.
Methods: We propose a model, the proportional odds ratio (POR) model, which makes no assumptions about the shape of ORp, a baseline function capturing the way OR changes across papers. The POR model does not assume homogeneity of ORs, but merely specifies a relationship between the ORs of the two tests. One may expand the domain of the POR model to cover dependent studies, multiple outcomes, multiple thresholds, multi-category or continuous tests, and individual-level data.
Results: In the paper we demonstrate how to formulate the model for a few real examples, and how to use widely available or popular statistical software (like SAS, R or S-Plus, and Stata) to fit the models, and estimate the discrimination accuracy of tests. Furthermore, we provide code for converting ORs into other measures of test performance like predictive values, post-test probabilities, and likelihood ratios, under mild conditions. Also we provide code to convert numerical results into graphical ones, like forest plots, heterogeneous ROC curves, and post test probability difference graphs.
Conclusions: The flexibility of POR model, coupled with ease with which it can be estimated in familiar software, suits the daily practice of meta-analysis and improves clinical decision-making.},

For such models, closed-form update expressions allow efficient computations without refitting the model. When similar notions of statistical influence are applied to mixed models, things are more complicated. Removing data points affects fixed effects and covariance parameter estimates. Update formulas for ``leave-one-out'' estimates typically fail to account for changes in covariance parameters. Moreover, in repeated measures or longitudinal studies, one is often interested in multivariate influence, rather than the impact of isolated points. This paper examines extensions of influence measures in linear mixed models and their implementation in the MIXED procedure.},

However, to limit instability and provide sensible regression models in the multivariable setting, a principled approach to model selection and function estimation is important.

The essential features are specifying a maximum acceptable complexity for each continuous function and applying a closed-test approach to each continuous predictor to simplify the model where possible. Important adjuncts are an initial choice of scale for continuous predictors (linear or logarithmic), which often helps one to generate realistic, parsimonious final models; a goodness-of-fit test for a parametric function of a predictor; and a preliminary predictor transformation to improve robustness.},

Participants 3900 males and females born in 1946. Main outcome measures Cognitive function from childhood to middle life (measured at ages 8, 11, 15, 26, and 43 years).
Results Birth weight was significantly and positively associated with cognitive ability at age 8 (with an estimated standard deviation score of 0.44 (95\% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.59)) between the lowest and highest birthweight categories after sex, father's social class, mother's education, and birth order were controlled for. This association was evident across the normal birthweight range ( {$>$} 2.5 kg) and so was not accounted for exclusively by low birth weight. The association was also observed at ages 11, 15, and 26, and weakly at age 43, although these associations were dependent on the association at age 8. Birth weight was also associated with education, with those of higher birth weight more likely to have achieved higher qualifications, and this effect was accounted for partly by cognitive function at age 8.
Conclusions Birth weight was associated with cognitive ability at age 8 in the general population, and in the normal birthweight range. The effect at this age largely explains associations between birth weight and cognitive function at subsequent ages. Similarly, the association between birth weight and education was accounted for partly by earlier cognitive scores.},

  abstract = {In non-life insurance, credibility estimates are appropriate for rating factors with many levels, where some have insufficient data. Traditional credibility theory models such multi-level factors as random effects, but does not treat the situation where there are also ordinary rating factors (fixed effects). Nelder and Verrall (1997) suggested using generalized linear models (GLMs) with both fixed and random effects and showed that in the absence of fixed effects, their result reduces to the classical credibility estimate. In this paper we further explore the relation between credibility and GLMs and derive MSE-based predictors of the random effects, by giving an extension of Jewell's theorem to the setting with both types of rating factors (fixed and random). We also derive sums-of-squares variance estimators in the spirit of traditional credibility theory and present an application to car model rating.},

In many cases, this may be an excessive simplification of the complicated relationships. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to test the hypothesized model against all possible kinds of relevant alternative models. Therefore, tests that perform well under more general circumstances are also required. This paper considers the semiparametric model, where the contribution of one of the model terms may not be strictly linear, and also proposes an exact F-test for the situation. The method also allows dependent error terms. The performance of the proposed test is illustrated by simulation experiments and in real air pollution and health data.

The motivating example is data with blood counts from cancer patients undergoing multiple cycles of chemotherapy, with days nested within cycles. Some inference questions relate to repeated measurements over days within cycle, while other questions are concerned with the dependence across cycles. When the desired inference relates to both levels of repetition, it becomes important to reflect the data structure in the model. We develop a semiparametric Bayesian modeling approach, restricting attention to two levels of repeated measurements. For the top-level longitudinal sampling model we use random effects to introduce the desired dependence across repeated measurements. We use a nonparametric prior for the random effects distribution. Inference about dependence across second-level repetition is implemented by the clustering implied in the nonparametric random effects model. Practical use of the model requires that the posterior distribution on the latent random effects be reasonably precise.},

CIFA is much faster in estimating multidimensional models, particularly with correlated dimensions. Overall, CIFA yields slightly more accurate parameter estimates, and FIML yields slightly more accurate standard errors. Yet, across most conditions, differences between methods are negligible. FIML is the best election in small sample sizes (200 observations). CIFA is the best election in larger samples (on computational grounds).

In real applications, when a multivariate process shifts, it occurs in either location or scale. Several methods have been proposed recently to monitor the covariance matrix. Most of these methods deal with a full rank covariance matrix, i.e., in a situation where the number of rational subgroups is larger than the number of variables. When the number of features is nearly as large as, or larger than, the number of observations, existing Shewhart-type charts do not provide a satisfactory solution because the estimated covariance matrix is singular. A new Shewhart-type chart for monitoring changes in the covariance matrix of a multivariate process when the number of observations available is less than the number of variables is proposed. This chart can be used to monitor the covariance matrix with only one observation. The new control chart is based on using the graphical LASSO estimator of the covariance matrix instead of the traditional sample covariance matrix. The LASSO estimator is used here because of desirable properties such as being non-singular and positive definite even when the number of observations is less than the number of variables. The performance of this new chart is compared to that of several Shewhart control charts for monitoring the covariance matrix.},

Sentencing councils and advisory boards have no role, as the guidance for the courts is given mainly in the form of legislative sentencing principles and court precedents. Legislative sentencing guidance has undergone changes both in form and substance. The 1970s decline of the rehabilitative ideal was mirrored in sentencing reforms that emphasized proportionality and predictability in sentencing. This was the case especially in Finland and Sweden. But unlike in many other countries, these ideological changes did not result to increased severity\textemdash{}for Finland the result was the opposite. While the Nordic legislators have shown increased interest in more detailed guidance of sentencing, courts are still left with a wide range of sentencing options and fairly broad penal latitudes. At the same time the sentencing systems place high value in consistency and uniformity in sentencing. To reconcile these aims, further devices are needed for the structuring of the sentencing decision, including legal-theoretical analyses and empirical research. The paper discusses the latter point in more detail with more recent research examples from Finland.},

Null distribution approximations are considered and simulations are done to evaluate these approximations. Simulations show that the LMP and GML tests are more powerful for low frequency functions while the GCV test is more powerful for high frequency functions, which is also true for Gaussian data (Liu and Wang (2004)). The tests are applied to data from the Wisconsin Epidemiology Study of Diabetic Retinopathy, the results of which confirm and provide more definite analysis than those of previous studies.

This class of models allows \textasciimacron{}exible functional dependence of an outcome variable on covariates by using nonparametric regression, while accounting for correlation between observations by using random effects. We estimate nonparametric functions by using smoothing splines and jointly estimate smoothing parameters and variance components by using marginal quasi-likelihood. Because numerical integration is often required by maximizing the objective functions, double penalized quasilikelihood is proposed to make approximate inference. Frequentist and Bayesian inferences are compared. A key feature of the method proposed is that it allows us to make systematic inference on all model components within a uni\textregistered{}ed parametric mixed model framework and can be easily implemented by \textregistered{}tting a working generalized linear mixed model by using existing statistical software. A bias correction procedure is also proposed to improve the performance of double penalized quasi-likelihood for sparse data.

These require a parametric (normality) assumption on the random effects, which may be unrealistic. Adapting a strategy of Stefanski and Carroll (1987, Biometrika 74, 703-716), we propose estimators for the generalized linear model parameters that require no assumptions on the random effects and yield consistent inference regardless of the true distribution.

The approach is illustrated by a two-level data set concerning the development and preliminary findings from an AIDS preventative intervention for Filipina commercial sex workers where the relationship between some latent quantities is investigated.},

The paper itself will explain concepts associated with trees so that when the comparisons are made, they are more easily understood.

The method uses the Kalman \textregistered{}lter and smoothing algorithm to obtain the conditional expectations of the unobserved data given the observations used in the E step of the EM algorithm. Maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are obtained wtihout the need to use nonlinear optimization routines. Using simulations, the method is shown to give identical results to maximum likelihood methods that use nonlinear optimization.},

Therefore, it is of practical importance to test the adequacy of this assumption, particularly the assumption of linear covariate effects. In this paper, we review procedures that can be used for testing polynomial covariate effects in these popular models. Specifically, four types of hypothesis testing approaches are reviewed, i.e. R tests, likelihood ratio tests, score tests and residualbased tests. Derivation and performance of each testing procedure will be discussed, including a small simulation study for comparing the likelihood ratio tests with the score tests.},

Ibrahim (1990, Journal of the American Statistical Association 85, 765\textendash{}769) provides a general method for estimating generalized linear regression models with missing covariates using the EM algorithm that is easily implemented when there is no auxiliary data. Vach (1997, Statistics in Medicine 16, 57\textendash{}72) describes how the method can be extended when the outcome and auxiliary data are conditionally independent given the covariates in the model. The method allows the incorporation of auxiliary data without making the conditional independence assumption. We suggest tests of conditional independence and compare the performance of several estimators in an example concerning mental health service utilization in children. Using an artificial dataset, we compare the performance of several estimators when auxiliary data are available.},

  volume = {58},

  abstract = {I.n this article, a new class of functional models in which smoothing splines are used to model fixed effects as well as random effectsis introduced. The linear mixed effects models are extended to nonparametric mixed effects models by introducing functional random effects, which are modeled as realizations of zero-mean stochastic processes. The fixed functional effects and the random functional effects are modeled in the same functional space, which guarantee the population-average and subject-specific curves have the same smoothness property. These models inherit the flexibility of the linear mixed effects models in handling complex designs and correlation structures, can include continuous covariates as well as dummy factors in both the fixed or random design matrices, and include the nested curves models as special cases. Two estimation procedures are proposed. The first estimation procedure exploits the connection between linear mixed effects models and smoothing splines and can be fitted using existing software. The second procedure is a sequential estimation procedure using Kalman filtering. This algorithm avoids inversion of large dimensional matrices and therefore can be applied to large data sets. A generalized maximum likelihood (GML) ratio test is proposed for inference and model selection. An application to comparison of cortisol profiles is used as an illustration.},

  abstract = {Sample survey inference is historically concerned with finitepopulation parameters, that is, functions (like means and totals) of the observations for the individuals in the population. In scientific applications, however, interest usually focuses on the ``superpopulation'' parameters associated with a stochastic mechanism hypothesized to generate the observations in the population rather than the finite-population parameters. Two relevant findings discussed in this paper are that (1) with stratified sampling, it is not sufficient to drop finite-population correction factors from standard design-based variance formulas to obtain appropriate variance formulas for superpopulation inference, and (2) with cluster sampling, standard design-based variance formulas can dramatically underestimate superpopulation variability, even with a small sampling fraction of the final units. A literature review of inference for superpopulation parameters is given, with emphasis on why these findings have not been previously appreciated. Examples are provided for estimating superpopulation means, linear regression coefficients and logistic regression coefficients using U.S. data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey, the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 1986 National Hospital Discharge Survey.},

We consider the problem of determining the significance of features such as peaks or valleys in observed covariate effects both for the case of additive modeling where the main predictor of interest is univariate as well as the problem of studying the significance of features such as peaks, inclines, ridges and valleys when the main predictor of interest is geographical location. We work with low rank radial spline smoothers to allow to the handling of sparse designs and large sample sizes. Reducing the problem to a Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) framework enables derivation of simulation-based critical value approximations and guards against the problem of multiple inferences over a range of predictor values. Such a reduction also allows for easy adjustment for confounders including those which have an unknown or complex effect on the outcome. A simulation study indicates that our method has satisfactory power. Finally, we illustrate our methodology on several data sets.},

  abstract = {Classic parametric statistical significance tests, such as analysis of variance and least squares regression, are widely used by researchers in many disciplines, including psychology. For classic parametric tests to produce accurate results, the assumptions underlying them (e.g., normality and homoscedasticity) must be satisfied. These assumptions are rarely met when analyzing real data. The use of classic parametric methods with violated assumptions can result in the inaccurate computation of p values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals. This may lead to substantive errors in the interpretation of data. Many modern robust statistical methods alleviate the problems inherent in using parametric methods with violated assumptions, yet modern methods are rarely used by researchers. The authors examine why this is the case, arguing that most researchers are unaware of the serious limitations of classic methods and are unfamiliar with modern alternatives. A range of modern robust and rank-based significance tests suitable for analyzing a wide range of designs is introduced. Practical advice on conducting modern analyses using software such as SPSS, SAS, and R is provided. The authors conclude by discussing robust effect size indices.},

IDA offers many potential advantages including increased statistical power, greater subject heterogeneity, higher observed frequencies of low base-rate behaviors, and longer developmental periods of study. However, a core challenge is the estimation of valid and reliable psychometric scores that are based on potentially different items with different response options drawn from different studies. In Bauer and Hussong (2009) we proposed a method for obtaining scores within an IDA called moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA). Here we move significantly beyond this work in the development of a general framework for estimating MNLFA models and obtaining scale scores across a variety of settings. We propose a five step procedure and demonstrate this approach using data drawn from n=1972 individuals ranging in age from 11 to 34 years pooled across three independent studies to examine the factor structure of 17 binary items assessing depressive symptomatology. We offer substantive conclusions about the factor structure of depression, use this structure to compute individual-specific scale scores, and make recommendations for the use of these methods in practice.},

  abstract = {In this article, we propose penalized spline (P-spline)-based methods for functional mixed effects models with varying coefficients. We decompose longitudinal outcomes as a sum of several terms: a population mean function, covariates with time-varying coefficients, functional subject-specific random effects, and residual measurement error processes. Using P-splines, we propose nonparametric estimation of the population mean function, varying coefficient, random subject-specific curves, and the associated covariance function that represents between-subject variation and the variance function of the residual measurement errors which represents within-subject variation. Proposed methods offer flexible estimation of both the population- and subject-level curves. In addition, decomposing variability of the outcomes as a between- and within-subject source is useful in identifying the dominant variance component therefore optimally model a covariance function. We use a likelihood-based method to select multiple smoothing parameters. Furthermore, we study the asymptotics of the baseline P-spline estimator with longitudinal data. We conduct simulation studies to investigate performance of the proposed methods. The benefit of the between- and within-subject covariance decomposition is illustrated through an analysis of Berkeley growth data, where we identified clearly distinct patterns of the between- and within-subject covariance functions of children's heights. We also apply the proposed methods to estimate the effect of antihypertensive treatment from the Framingham Heart Study data.},

It explores the variables that determine a firm's R\&D collaborative expenditure by means of a sample of Italian firms. A tobit model, adjusted for heteroscedasticity and non-normality (Inverse Hyperbolic Sin transformation to the dependent variable), is used to deal with the large number of zero responses. Size, public grants and innovation are found to be effective in determining the level of cooperative R\&D expenditure. Absorptive capacity, expressed by the in-house stable R\&D effort, also plays an important role. This is in line with the idea that internal R\&D is required if a firm is to take advantage of the outcomes of external R\&D investment.},

  abstract = {Random intercept models for binary data are useful tools for addressing between subject heterogeneity. Unlike linear models, the non-linearity of link functions used for binary data force a distinction between marginal and conditional random intercept models. This distinction is blurred in probit models with a normally distributed random intercept because the resulting model implies a probit marginal link as well. That is, this model is closed in the sense that the distribution associated with the marginal and conditional link functions and the random effect distribution are all of the same family. In this manuscript we explore another family of random intercept models with this property. In particular, we consider instances when the distributions associated with the conditional and marginal link functions and the random effect distribution are mixtures of normals. We show that this flexible family of models is related to several others presented in the literature. Moreover, we show that this family of models offers considerable computational benefits. A diverse series of examples illustrates the wide applicability of the approach.},

  issn = {0886-9383, 1099-128X},
  abstract = {A statistical framework is developed to contrast methods used for parameter estimation for a latent variable multivariate regression (LVMR) model. This model involves two sets of variables, X and Y, both with multiple variables and sharing a common latent structure with additive random errors. The methods contrasted are partial least squares (PLS) regression, principal component regression (PCR), reduced rank regression (RRR) and canonical co-ordinate regression (CCR). The framework is based on a constrained maximum likelihood analysis of the model under assumptions of multivariate normality. The constraint is that the estimates of the latent variables are restricted to be linear functions of the X variables, which is the form of the estimates for the methods being contrasted. The resulting framework is a continuum regression that goes from RRR to PCR depending on the ratio of error variances in the X and Y spaces. PLS does not arise as a member of the continuum; however, the method does offer some insight into why PLS would work well in practice. The constrained maximum likelihood result is also compared with the unconstrained maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the impact of the constraint. The results are illustrated on a simulated example. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This article investigates electoral irregularities in the 1990 to 2005 Bundestag elections of unified Germany. Drawing on the Second Digit Benford Law (2BL) by Mebane (2006), the analysis consists of comparing the observed frequencies of numerals of candidate votes and party votes at the precinct level against the expected frequencies according to Benford's Law. Four central findings stand out. First, there is no evidence for systematic fraud or mismanagement with regard to candidate votes from districts where fraud would be most instrumental. Second, at the state level (Bundesland), there are 51 violations in 190 tests of the party list votes. Third, East German states are not more prone to violations than Western ones. This finding refutes the notion that the East's more recent transition to democracy poses problems in electoral management. Fourth, a strong variation in patterns of violation across Bundesl{\"a}nder exists: states with dominant party control are more likely to display irregularities. The article concludes by hypothesizing and exploring the notion that partisan composition of nominees involved in the counting may produce a higher likelihood of violation and be a cause of L{\"a}nder variation. This may especially be the case when a party dominates in a Bundesland or opponents to the former socialist regime party are involved in the counting.},

  abstract = {A Non-Parametric Maximum Likelihood approach to the estimation of relative risks in the context of disease mapping is discussed and a NPML approximation to conditional autoregressive models is proposed. NPML estimates have been compared to other proposed solutions (Maximum Likelihood via Monte Carlo Scoring, Hierarchical Bayesian models) using real examples. Overall, the NPML autoregressive estimates (with weighted term) were closer to the Bayesian estimates. The exchangeable NPML model ranked immediately after, even if it implied a greater shrinkage, while the truncated auto-Poisson showed inadequate for disease mapping. The coe cients of the autoregressive term for the di erent mixtures have clear interpretations: in the breast cancer example, the larger cities in the region showed high rates and very low correlation with the neighbouring areas, while the less populated rural areas with low rates were strongly positively correlated each other. This pattern is expected since breast cancer is strongly correlated with parity and age at {\"y}rst birth, and the female population of the rural areas experienced a decline in fertility much later than those living in the larger cities. The leukemia example highlighted the failure of the Poisson-Gamma model and other general overdispersion tests to detect high risk areas under speci{\"y}c conditions. The NPML approach in Aitkin is very general, simple and exible. However the user should be warned against the possibility of local maxima and the di culty in detecting the optimal number of components.

The factorization enables us to tractably implement the maximum a posteriori and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criteria as two statistical approaches for estimating the unknowns. We compare the derived statistical methods with well-known techniques for the recovery of sparse signals, such as the 1 norm and Log ( 1- 0 relaxation) regularization methods.

Unlike more common time series techniques such as spectral analysis and ARIMA models, dynamic factor analysis can analyse short, non-stationary time series containing missing values. Typically, the parameters in dynamic factor analysis are estimated by direct optimisation, which means that only small data sets can be analysed if computing time is not to become prohibitively long and the chances of obtaining sub-optimal estimates are to be avoided.

  title = {{{IDR}}/{{QR}}: {{An Incremental Dimension Reduction Algorithm}} via {{QR Decomposition}}},
  abstract = {Dimension reduction is a critical data preprocessing step for many database and data mining applications, such as efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional data. In the literature, a well-known dimension reduction algorithm is Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The common aspect of previously proposed LDA-based algorithms is the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Due to the difficulty of designing an incremental solution for the eigenvalue problem on the product of scatter matrices in LDA, there has been little work on designing incremental LDA algorithms that can efficiently incorporate new data items as they become available. In this paper, we propose an LDA-based incremental dimension reduction algorithm, called IDR/QR, which applies QR Decomposition rather than SVD. Unlike other LDA-based algorithms, this algorithm does not require the whole data matrix in main memory. This is desirable for large data sets. More importantly, with the insertion of new data items, the IDR/QR algorithm can constrain the computational cost by applying efficient QR-updating techniques. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the IDR/QR algorithm in terms of classification error rate on the reduced dimensional space. Our experiments on several real-world data sets reveal that the classification error rate achieved by the IDR/QR algorithm is very close to the best possible one achieved by other LDA-based algorithms. However, the IDR/QR algorithm has much less computational cost, especially when new data items are inserted dynamically.},

In an application the presented models are used to analyze the number of benefits received per patient in a German private health insurance company. Since the deviance information criterion (DIC) is only appropriate for exponential family models, we use in addition the Vuong and Clarke test with a Schwarz correction to compare possibly non nested models. We illustrate how they can be used in a Bayesian context.},

  abstract = {This package vignette is an up-to-date version of Alfons and Templ (2013), published in the Journal of Statistical Software. Units sampled from finite populations typically come with different inclusion probabilities. Together with additional preprocessing steps of the raw data, this yields unequal sampling weights of the observations. Whenever indicators are estimated from such complex samples, the corresponding sampling weights have to be taken into account. In addition, many indicators suffer from a strong influence of outliers, which are a common problem in real-world data. The R package laeken is an object-oriented toolkit for the estimation of indicators from complex survey samples via standard or robust methods. In particular the most widely used social exclusion and poverty indicators are implemented in the package. A general calibrated bootstrap method to estimate the variance of indicators for common survey designs is included as well. Furthermore, the package contains synthetically generated close-to-reality data for the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions and the Structure of Earnings Survey, which are used in the code examples throughout the paper. Even though the paper is focused on showing the functionality of package laeken, it also provides a brief mathematical description of the implemented indicator methodology.},

We propose local principal curves as a tool to describe and model speed-flow data, which takes this viewpoint into account. We introduce the concept of calibration curves to determine the relationship between the latent variable (represented by the parametrization of the principal curve) and the traffic density. We apply local principal curves to a variety of speed-flow diagrams from Californian freeways, including some so far unreported patterns.},

  abstract = {Estimation of treatment effects with causal interpretation from observational data is complicated because exposure to treatment may be confounded with subject characteristics. The propensity score, the probability of treatment exposure conditional on covariates, is the basis for two approaches to adjusting for confounding: methods based on stratification of observations by quantiles of estimated propensity scores and methods based on weighting observations by the inverse of estimated propensity scores. We review popular versions of these approaches and related methods offering improved precision, describe theoretical properties and highlight their implications for practice, and present extensive comparisons of performance that provide guidance for practial use.},

  abstract = {Maximum-likelihood estimation of the parameters of a continuous-time model for irregularly sampled data is very sensitive to initial conditions. Simulations may converge to a good solution if the true parameters are used as starting values for the nonlinear search of the minimum of the negative log likelihood. From realizable starting values, the convergence to a continuoustime model with an accurate spectrum is rare if more than three parameters have to be estimated. A discrete-time spectral estimator that applies a new algorithm for automatic equidistant missing-data analysis to irregularly spaced data is introduced. This requires equidistant resampling of the data. A slotted nearest neighbor (NN) resampling method replaces a true irregular observation time instant by the nearest equidistant resampling time point if and only if the distance to the true time is within half the slot width. It will be shown that this new resampling algorithm with the slotting principle has favorable properties over existing schemes such as NN resampling. A further improvement is obtained by using a slot width that is only a fraction of the resampling time.},

  abstract = {In order to organize and retrieve the ever growing collection of multimedia objects on the Web, many algorithms have been developed to automatically tag images, music and videos. One source of labeled data for training these algorithms are tags collected from the Web, via collaborative tagging websites (e.g., Flickr, Last.FM and YouTube) or crowdsourcing applications (e.g., human computation games and Mechanical Turk). A common approach is to use tags directly as labels for training algorithms in a supervised way. This approach is problematic, because the presence of synonyms and misspellings amongst the tags creates a label space that is overly fragmented, with a huge number of classes, many of which are sparse and semantically equivalent to one another. In this work, we investigate a method for training tagging algorithms using a reduced set of labels corresponding to topics derived from the tags. We show that our proposed method is comparable, in terms of annotation and retrieval performance, to the method of using tags directly as labels, while being more efficient to train (as there are fewer classes) and less wasteful (eliminating the need to discard tags that are associated with too few examples). We demonstrate our results using a dataset collected by a human computation game, called TagATune.},

  shorttitle = {Modelling {{Time Series Count Data}}},
  abstract = {This paper introduces and evaluates new models for time series count data. The Autoregressive Conditional Poisson model (ACP) makes it possible to deal with issues of discreteness, overdispersion (variance greater than the mean) and serial correlation. A fully parametric approach is taken and a marginal distribution for the counts is specified, where conditional on past observations the mean is autoregressive. This enables to attain improved inference on coefficients of exogenous regressors relative to static Poisson regression, which is the main concern of the existing literature, while modelling the serial correlation in a flexible way. A variety of models, based on the double Poisson distribution of Efron (1986) is introduced, which in a first step introduce an additional dispersion parameter and in a second step make this dispersion parameter time-varying. All models are estimated using maximum likelihood which makes the usual tests available. In this framework autocorrelation can be tested with a straightforward likelihood ratio test, whose simplicity is in sharp contrast with test procedures in the latent variable time series count model of Zeger (1988). The models are applied to the time series of monthly polio cases in the U.S between 1970 and 1983 as well as to the daily number of price change durations of .75\$ on the IBM stock. A .75\$ price-change duration is defined as the time it takes the stock price to move by at least .75\$. The variable of interest is the daily number of such durations, which is a measure of intradaily volatility, since the more volatile the stock price is within a day, the larger the counts will be. The ACP models provide good density forecasts of this measure of volatility.},

Correlation between s and f may exist and be of direct interest. We propose Bayesian multivariate Poisson models for the bivariate response (s, f), correlated through random effects.

The study is motivated by the unexpected observation that alcohol consumption decreased despite of increased availability, which may be due to sample attrition of heavy drinkers. Several imputation methods have been proposed, but rarely compared in longitudinal studies of alcohol consumption. The imputation of consumption level measurements is computationally particularly challenging due to alcohol consumption being a semi-continuous variable (dichotomous drinking status and continuous volume among drinkers), and the non-normality of data in the continuous part. Data come from a longitudinal study in Denmark with four waves (2003\textendash{}2006) and 1771 individuals at baseline. Five techniques for missing data are compared: Last value carried forward (LVCF) was used as a single, and Hotdeck, Heckman modelling, multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), and a Bayesian approach as multiple imputation methods. Predictive mean matching was used to account for non-normality, where instead of imputing regression estimates, ``real'' observed values from similar cases are imputed. Methods were also compared by means of a simulated dataset. The simulation showed that the Bayesian approach yielded the most unbiased estimates for imputation. The finding of no increase in consumption levels despite a higher availability remained unaltered.},

In this paper it is shown that the solution to Lasso, in addition to its sparsity, has robustness properties: it is the solution to a robust optimization problem. This has two important consequences. First, robustness provides a connection of the regularizer to a physical property, namely, protection from noise. This allows a principled selection of the regularizer, and in particular, generalizations of Lasso that also yield convex optimization problems are obtained by considering different uncertainty sets. Second, robustness can itself be used as an avenue for exploring different properties of the solution. In particular, it is shown that robustness of the solution explains why the solution is sparse. The analysis as well as the specific results obtained differ from standard sparsity results, providing different geometric intuition. Furthermore, it is shown that the robust optimization formulation is related to kernel density estimation, and based on this approach, a proof that Lasso is consistent is given, using robustness directly. Finally, a theorem is proved which states that sparsity and algorithmic stability contradict each other, and hence Lasso is not stable.},

To delineate these conditions, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to compute empirical CI coverage rates in samples drawn from 36 populations with a wide range of data characteristics. We also computed the empirical CI coverage rates for 4 alternative methods that have been discussed in the literature: noncentrality interval estimation, the delta method, the percentile bootstrap, and the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap. Our results showed that for many data-parameter configurations\textemdash{}for example, sample size, predictor correlations, coefficient of determination (R2), orientation of NL with respect to the eigenvectors of the predictor correlation matrix, RX\textemdash{}the standard method produced coverage rates that were close to their expected values. However, when population R2 was large and when NL approached the last eigenvector of RX, then the standard method coverage rates were frequently below the nominal rate (sometimes by a considerable amount). In these conditions, the delta method and the 2 bootstrap procedures were consistently accurate. Results using noncentrality interval estimation were inconsistent. In light of these findings, we recommend that researchers use the delta method to evaluate the sampling variability of standardized regression coefficients.},

There is, however, often a need to model more complicated frailty structures, but attempts to extend gamma frailties run into complications. Motivated by hip replacement data with a more complicated dependence structure, we propose a model based on multiplicative frailties with a multivariate log-normal joint distribution. We give a justification and an estimation procedure for this generally structured frailty model, which is a generalization of the one presented by McGilchrist (1993, Biometrics 49, 221-225). The estimation is based on Laplace approximation of the likelihood function. This leads to estimating equations based on a penalized fixed effects partial likelihood, where the marginal distribution of the frailty terms determines the penalty term. The tuning parameters of the penalty function, i.e., the frailty variances, are estimated by maximizing an approximate profile likelihood. The performance of the approximation is evaluated by simulation, and the frailty model is fitted to the hip replacement data.},

We investigated the extent to which this association might be explained by genetic factors. Methods: We used data from the Swedish Twin Registry on twins born 1886-1958 who answered a questionnaire in 1969/1970 or 1972 (n = 44,258). Information on mortality from all-causes (n = 14,217), cardiovascular disease (CVD; n = 9009), and coronary heart disease (CHD; n = 3564) was obtained by linkage to the national Causes of Death Registry for the years 1972-2004. The association between BMI and mortality was studied without control for genetic factors in cohort analyses and with control for genetic factors in co-twin control analyses.
Results: In cohort analyses, there was a clear dose-response rela? tionship between BMI and mortality. Hazard ratios per 1 unit increase in BMI in subjects with BMI {$>$}18.5 were 1.05 (95\% confidence interval = 1.05-1.06) for all-cause mortality, 1.07 (1.07? 1.09) for CVD mortality, and 1.09 (1.08-1.10) for CHD mortality. Similar results were seen in co-twin control analyses of dizygotic twins. However, within monozygotic twins, BMI was associated with death from CHD (OR = 1.06; 1.00-1.12), whereas the asso? ciation with all-cause mortality (1.01, 0.98-1.04) and CVD mortal? ity (1.02, 0.98-1.06) was weak.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there is an association between high BMI and mortality from CHD that is not explained by genetic confounding. However, a large part of the association},

  abstract = {Changes in human microbiome are associated with many human diseases. Next generation sequencing technologies make it possible to quantify the microbial composition without the need for laboratory cultivation. One important problem of microbiome data analysis is to identify the environmental/biological covariates that are associated with different bacterial taxa. Taxa count data in microbiome studies are often over-dispersed and include many zeros. To account for such an overdispersion, we propose to use an additive logistic normal multinomial regression model to associate the covariates to bacterial composition. The model can naturally account for sampling variabilities and zero observations and also allow for a flexible covariance structure among the bacterial taxa. In order to select the relevant covariates and to estimate the corresponding regression coefficients, we propose a group 1 penalized likelihood estimation method for variable selection and estimation. We develop a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm to implement the penalized likelihood estimation. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the group 1 penalized multinomial logistic regression and the Dirichlet multinomial regression models in variable selection. We demonstrate the methods using a data set that links human gut microbiome to micro-nutrients in order to identify the nutrients that are associated with the human gut microbiome enterotype.

  shorttitle = {Dirichlet Component Analysis},
  abstract = {We consider feature extraction (dimensionality reduction) for compositional data, where the data vectors are constrained to be positive and constant-sum. In real-world problems, the data components (variables) usually have complicated ``correlations'' while their total number is huge. Such scenario demands feature extraction. That is, we shall de-correlate the components and reduce their dimensionality. Traditional techniques such as the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) are not suitable for these problems due to unique statistical properties and the need to satisfy the constraints in compositional data. This paper presents a novel approach to feature extraction for compositional data. Our method first identifies a family of dimensionality reduction projections that preserve all relevant constraints, and then finds the optimal projection that maximizes the estimated Dirichlet precision on projected data. It reduces the compositional data to a given lower dimensionality while the components in the lower-dimensional space are de-correlated as much as possible. We develop theoretical foundation of our approach, and validate its effectiveness on some synthetic and realworld datasets.},

Multivariate statistics methods including regression analysis have been adopted to model compositional data, but the existing research is still scattered and fragmented. This paper contributes to modeling the linear regression relationship for compositional data as both dependent and independent variables. First, some operations in Simplex space, such as the perturbation operation, the power transformation, and the inner product, are defined for compositional-data vectors. The regression models are then built by the original compositional data and transformed data, respectively, after the introduction of the Isometric Logratio Transformation (ilr). By theoretical inference, it turns out that the two models are equivalent in essence using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. Two measures for testing goodness of fit, i.e., the observed squared correlation coefficient R2 and the cross validated squared correlation coefficient Q2, are also proposed to evaluate the regression models. Besides, the estimated regression parameters are explained to indicate the notion of relative elasticity. An empirical analysis finally illustrates the usefulness of the multiple linear regression models for compositional-data variables.},

  abstract = {Perturbation on the simplex is an operation which can be used to numerically describe changes in the composition of, for example, soils, sediments, or rocks. The combination of perturbation and power transformation provides a strong tool for analyzing compositional linear processes in the simplex. When the process is constrained in the sense of a well-known starting (or final) composition, noncentred principal component analysis can be used to estimate the leading perturbation vector of the process. Applying these mathematical tools to chemical major element data from a weathering profile developed on granitoid rocks allows us to model the compositional changes associated with the process of chemical weathering. The comparison of these results with the compositional linear trend defined by erosional products of several of the world's major drainage systems yields close similarities. The latter observation allows for a mathematical formulation of a global mean weathering trend within the system Al2O3\textendash{}CaO\textendash{}Na2O\textendash{}K2O. We further demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for validating processes behind individual trends and for combining the effects of different processes which modify the composition of soils, sediments, and rocks. Alternatives to the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) are discussed to obtain a translation-invariant scale for the process of chemical weathering.},

  abstract = {Trends in compositional diagrams are frequently used to describe and interpret the imprint of certain processes on sediment composition. Most of these trends are intuitive and bhand-drawnQ, although a numerical description of compositional changes involved with these processes would allow for a quantitative assessment of the observed sediment compositions and the proposed processes. This paper suggests a statistical approach to model compositional linear trends, which allows for a mathematically rigorous description of changes in sediment composition related to a specific process or a combination of processes. Three case studies dealing with different aspects of the sedimentary cycle demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. In the first example, a modelled average global chemical weathering trend is used to calculate an appropriate measure for the degree of chemical weathering of the suspended load from some of the world's major rivers. In the second example, data on precipitation and relief from different watersheds are quantitatively related to the petrographic composition of fine-grained sands from low-order streams derived from these watersheds. The third example is an attempt to quantify the interdependence of chemical sediment composition and grain size in the absence of chemical weathering. Superposition of individual compositional linear trends allows for modelling sediment composition in more complicated case studies. Although primarily a forward modelling approach, it can be also used inversely, and, therefore, has strong potential for tracing back the sedimentforming processes in order to reconstruct the original source rocks of the sediment.},

In most cases they are recorded as closed data, i.e. data summing to a constant, such as 100\% - whole-rock geochemical data being classic examples. Compositional data have important and particular properties that preclude the application of standard statistical techniques on such data in raw form. Standard techniques are designed to be used with data that are free to range from -oo to +oo. Compositional data are always positive and range only from 0 to 100, or any other constant, when given in closed form. If one component increases, others must, perforce, decrease, whether or not there is a genetic link between these components. This means that the results of standard statistical analysis of the relationships between raw components or parts in a compositional dataset are clouded by spurious effects. Although such analyses may give apparently interpretable results, they are, at best, approximations and need to be treated with considerable circumspection. The methods outlined in this volume are based on the premise that it is the relative variation of components which is of interest, rather than absolute variation. Log-ratios of components provide the natural means of studying compositional data. In this contribution the basic terms and operations are introduced using simple numerical examples to illustrate their computation and to familiarize the reader with their use.},

Thus, it satisfies analogous properties to the arithmetic mean as a BLU estimator of the expected value in real space.

These types of data arise whenever we classify objects into disjoint categories and record their resulting relative frequencies, or partition a whole measurement into percentage contributions from its various parts. Under the unit-sum constraint, the elementary concepts of covariance and correlation are misleading. Therefore, compositional data are rarely analyzed with the usual multivariate statistical methods. Aitchison (1986) introduced the logratio analysis to model compositional data. Campbell and Mosimann (1987a) suggested the Dirichlet Covariate Model as a null model for such data. In this paper we investigate the Dirichlet Covariate Model and compare it to the logratio analysis. Maximum likelihood estimation methods are developed and the sampling distributions of these estimates are investigated. Measures of total variability and goodness of fit are proposed to assess the adequacy of the suggested models in analyzing compositional data.},

  abstract = {Compositional data (almost all data in geochemistry) are closed data, i.e. they sum up to a constant (e.g. 100 weight percent). Thus the correlation structure of compositional data is strongly biased and results of many multivariate techniques become doubtful without a proper transformation of the data. The centered logratio transformation (clr) is often used to open closed data. However the transformed data do not have full rank following a logratio transformation and cannot be used for robust multivariate techniques like principal component analysis (PCA). Here we propose to use the isometric logratio transformation (ilr) instead. However, the ilr transformation has the disadvantage that the resulting new variables are no longer directly interpretable in terms of the originally entered variables. Here we propose a technique how the resulting scores and loadings of a robust PCA on ilr transformed data can be back-transformed and interpreted. The procedure is demonstrated using a real data set from regional geochemistry and compared to results from non-transformed and non-robust versions of PCA. It turns out that the procedure using ilr transformed data and robust PCA delivers superior results to all other approaches. The examples demonstrate that due to the compositional nature of geochemical data PCA should not be carried out without an appropriate transformation. Furthermore a robust approach is preferable if the dataset contains outliers.},

These early approaches suggested the statistical hypothesis of logistic-normality of the compositional residuals to test the model and its coefficients. Also, the Dirichlet distribution has been proposed as an alternative model for compositional residuals, but it leads to restrictive and not easy-to-use regressions. Recent advances on the Euclidean geometry of the simplex and on the logistic-normal distribution allow re-formulating simplicial regression with logistic-normal residuals. Estimation of the model is presented as a least-squares problem in the simplex and is formulated in terms of orthonormal coordinates. This estimation decomposes into simple linear regression models which can be assessed independently. Marginal normality of the coordinate-residuals suffices to check influence of covariables using standard regression tests. Examples illustrate the proposed procedures.},

This is done by way of orthonormal bases, which allow for a straightforward handling of geometric elements in the simplex. The transformation into real coordinates preserves all metric properties and is thus called isometric logratio transformation (ilr). An important result is the decomposition of the simplex, as a vector space, into orthogonal subspaces associated with nonoverlapping subcompositions. This gives the key to join compositions with different parts into a single composition by using a balancing element. The relationship between ilr transformations and the centered-logratio (clr) and additive-logratio (alr) transformations is also studied. Exponential growth or decay of mass is used to illustrate compositional linear processes, parallelism and orthogonality in the simplex.},

Both conditional mean models, estimable by NLS and quasi-maximum likelihood (QML), and fully parametric models (Dirichlet and Dirichlet-multinomial), estimable by ML, are considered. In contrast to previous papers but similarly to the univariate case, a new parameterization is proposed here for the parametric models, which allows the same specification of the conditional mean of interest to be used in all models, irrespective of the specific functional form adopted for it. The text also discusses at some length the specification analysis of fractional regression models. All the proposed types of tests of the conditional mean can be performed through artificial OLS regressions, with test statistics evaluated at QML or NLS estimates. The paper also includes an extensive Monte Carlo study evaluating the finite sample properties of most of the estimators and tests considered.},

While the likelihood function is available in closed-form for continuous responses, in the non-continuous setting numerical approximations are used. Residual analysis and a specification test are suggested for validating the adequacy of the assumed multivariate model. Methodology is implemented in a R package called gcmr.

Most research on count data regression models focus on univariate cases where the single dependent variable takes on non-negative integer. While Chou and Steenhard (2009) provided a SAS\textregistered{} macro program that handles a wide variety of univariate count data distributions, no study has provided a SAS program to estimate bivariate count regression models. This paper develops a SAS\textregistered{} macro program jointly estimate two correlated count data series---the bivariate count regression model. Our SAS\textregistered{} macro allows for ten bivariate count data distributions: bivariate Poisson, bivariate Poisson-LogNormal, bivariate negative binomial, bivariate generalized Poisson, bivariate Poisson inverse Gaussian, bivariate Borel-Tanner, bivariate Neyman Type A, bivariate generalized Waring, Poisson-Laguerre polynomial, and bivariate Poisson series expansion. In addition, the macro also provides estimation of the above bivariate distributions using a copula approach. Bivariate zero-inflated, bivariate hurdle, bivariate truncated, and bivariate censored regression models can also be estimated with this SAS\textregistered{} macro. We apply this SAS\textregistered{} macro procedure to a healthcare utilization data.

  volume = {68},
  issn = {0033-3123, 1860-0980},
  abstract = {Studies of agreement commonly occur in psychiatric research. For example, researchers are often interested in the agreement among radiologists in their review of brain scans of elderly patients with dementia or in the agreement among multiple informant reports of psychopathology in children. In this paper, we consider the agreement between two raters when rating a dichotomous outcome (e.g., presence or absence of psychopathology). In particular, we consider logistic regression models that allow agreement to depend on both rater- and subject-level covaxiates. Logistic regression has been proposed as a simple method for identifying covariates that are predictive of agreement (Coughlin et al., 1992). However, this approach is problematic since it does not take account of agreement due to chance alone. As a result, a spurious association between the probability (or odds) of agreement and a covariate could arise due entirely to chance agreement. That is, if the prevalence of the dichotomous outcome varies among subgroups of the population, then covariates that identify the subgroups may appear to be predictive of agreement. In this paper we propose a modification to the standard logistic regression model in order to take proper account of chance agreement. An attractive feature of the proposed method is that it can be easily implemented using existing statistical software for logistic regression. The proposed method is motivated by data from the Connecticut Child Study (Zahner et al., 1992) on the agreement among parent and teacher reports of psychopathology in children. In this study, parents and teachers provide dichotomous assessments of a child's psychopathology and it is of interest to examine whether agreement among the parent and teacher reports is related to the age and gender of the child and to the time elapsed between parent and teacher assessments of the child.},

  abstract = {Two-stage predictor substitution (2SPS) and the two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) are two approaches to instrumental variable (IV) analysis. While 2SPS and 2SRI with linear models are well-studied methods of causal inference, the properties of 2SPS and 2SRI for logistic binary outcomes have not been thoroughly studied. We study the bias and variance properties of 2SPS and 2SRI for a logistic outcome model so that we can apply these IV approaches to the causal inference of binary outcomes. We also propose and implement an extension of generalized structure mean model originally developed for a randomized trial. We first present closed form expressions of asymptotic bias for the causal odds ratio from both 2SPS and 2SRI approaches. Our closed form bias results show that the 2SPS logistic regression generates asymptotically biased estimates of this causal odds ratio when there is no unmeasured confounding and that this bias increases with increasing unmeasured confounding. The 2SRI logistic regression is asymptotically unbiased when there is no unmeasured confounding, but when there is unmeasured confounding, there is bias and it increases with increasing unmeasured confounding. In the second part, we propose the sandwich variance estimator of logistic regression of both 2SPS and 2SRI approaches and the variance estimator is adjusted for the fact that the estimates from the first stage regression is included as covariates in the second stage regression. The simulation results show that the adjusted estimates are consistent with the observed variance while the naive estimates without the adjustments are biased. This study also shows that the 2SRI method has a larger variance than the 2SPS method. Lastly, we compare the 2SPS and 2SRI logistic regression with the generalized structure mean model (GSMM). Our simulation results show that the GSMM is an unbiased estimator of complier-average causal effect (CACE) and has the least variance among the three approaches. We apply these three methods to the analysis of the GPRD database on antidiabetic effect of bezafibrate.},

In this framework, a relevant computational tool is given by simulation which leads to deal with methodological problems not solvable analytically. Simulation is frequently used for the generation of variates from known distributions with Monte Carlo methods for the study of the behavior of statistics for which the sampling distribution is unknown. Moreover, Monte Carlo algorithms have been developed which can be also used to approximate the stochastic integrals, as in bayesian statistical analysis and in optimization problems. The application of such algorithms needs the application of advanced computational tools and, particularly, computer algebra systems are surely one of the most suitable tools for the simulation of complex stochastic models. In this paper we present the methods used for the implementation of some procedures which use Monte Carlo algorithms to obtain random vectors from multivariate continuous distributions in a computer algebra system, specifically Mathematica.},

  abstract = {The EM algorithm of Dempster, Laird, and Rubin (1977) is a broadly applicable approach that has been widely applied to the iterative computation of maximum likelihood estimates in a variety of incomplete-data problems. A criticism that has been levelled at the EM algorithm is that its convergence can be quite slow. Unfortunately, methods to accelerate the EM algorithm do tend to sacri ce the simplicity it usually enjoys. In this paper, we review some available methods for accelerating convergence of the EM algorithm. In particular, we consider the use of the multivariate version of Aitken's method for EM acceleration. Other methods to be considered include the conjugate gradient approach of Jamshidian and Jennrich (1993) and the quasi-Newton approach of Lange (1995b). We also consider the recently proposed ECME algorithm of Liu and Rubin (1994).},

The analysis of this data set is challenging due to several difficulties, namely, nonignorable missing longitudinal responses and baseline covariates. Hence, we propose a selection model for estimating parameters in the normal random effects model with nonignorable missing responses and covariates. Parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood using the Gibbs sampler and a Monte Carlo expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Standard errors are calculated using the bootstrap. The method allows for nonmonotone patterns of missing data in both the response variable and the covariates. We model the missing data mechanism and the missing covariate distribution via a sequence of one-dimensional conditional distributions, allowing the missing covariates to be either categorical or continuous, as well as time-varying. We apply the proposed approach to the ECOG quality-of-life data and conduct a small simulation study evaluating the performance of the maximum likelihood estimates. Our results indicate that a patient treated with the vaccine has a higher QOL score on average at a given time point than a patient treated with high-dose interferon.},

  abstract = {We consider longitudinal studies in which the outcome observed over time is binary and the covariates of interest are categorical. With no missing responses or covariates, one specifies a multinomial model for the responses given the covariates and uses maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters. Unfortunately, incomplete data in the responses and covariates are a common occurrence in longitudinal studies. Here we assume the missing data are missing at random (Rubin, 1976, Biometrika 63, 581-592). Since all of the missing data (responses and covariates) are categorical, a useful technique for obtaining maximum likelihood parameter estimates is the EM algorithm by the method of weights proposed in Ibrahim (1990, Journal of the American Statistical Association 85, 765-769). In using the EM algorithm with missing responses and covariates, one specifies the joint distribution of the responses and covariates. Here we consider the parameters of the covariate distribution as a nuisance. In data sets where the percentage of missing data is high, the estimates of the nuisance parameters can lead to highly unstable estimates of the parameters of interest. We propose a conditional model for the covariate distribution that has several modeling advantages for the EM algorithm and provides a reduction in the number of nuisance parameters, thus providing more stable estimates in finite samples.},

We extend this method to continuous or mixed categorical and continuous covariates, and for arbitrary parametric regression models, by adapting a Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm as discussed by Wei and Tanner (1990, Journal of the American Statistical Association 85, 699-704). In addition, we discuss the Gibbs sampler for sampling from the conditional distribution of the missing covariates given the observed data and show that the appropriate complete conditionals are log-concave. The log-concavity property of the conditional distributions will facilitate a straightforward implementation of the Gibbs sampler via the adaptive rejection algorithm of Gilks and Wild (1992, Applied Statistics 41, 337-348). We assume the model for the response given the covariates is an arbitrary parametric regression model, such as a generalized linear model, a parametric survival model, or a nonlinear model. We model the marginal distribution of the covariates as a product of onedimensional conditional distributions. This allows us a great deal of flexibility in modeling the distribution of the covariates and reduces the number of nuisance parameters that are introduced in the E-step. We present examples involving both simulated and real data.},

  abstract = {This article discusses a general framework for smoothing parameter estimation for models with regular likelihoods constructed in terms of unknown smooth functions of covariates. Gaussian random effects and parametric terms may also be present. By construction the method is numerically stable and convergent, and enables smoothing parameter uncertainty to be quantified. The latter enables us to fix a well known problem with AIC for such models, thereby improving the range of model selection tools available. The smooth functions are represented by reduced rank spline like smoothers, with associated quadratic penalties measuring function smoothness. Model estimation is by penalized likelihood maximization, where the smoothing parameters controlling the extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. The methods cover, for example, generalized additive models for nonexponential family responses (e.g., beta, ordered categorical, scaled t distribution, negative binomial and Tweedie distributions), generalized additive models for location scale and shape (e.g., two stage zero inflation models, and Gaussian location-scale models), Cox proportional hazards models and multivariate additive models. The framework reduces the implementation of new model classes to the coding of some standard derivatives of the log-likelihood. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Current fitting procedures for GAMLSS are infeasible for high-dimensional data setups and require variable selection based on (potentially problematic) information criteria. The present work describes a boosting algorithm for high-dimensional GAMLSS that was developed to overcome these limitations. Specifically, the new algorithm was designed to allow the simultaneous estimation of predictor effects and variable selection. The proposed algorithm was applied to data of the Munich Rental Guide, which is used by landlords and tenants as a reference for the average rent of a flat depending on its characteristics and spatial features. The net-rent predictions that resulted from the high-dimensional GAMLSS were found to be highly competitive while covariate-specific prediction intervals showed a major improvement over classical GAMs.},

As reduction in covariate imbalance may suggest increased IV validity, we sought to examine the covariate balance and instrument strength in 25 formulations of the PPP IV in two cohort studies. Study Design and Setting: We applied the PPP IV to assess antipsychotic medication (APM) use and subsequent death among two cohorts of elderly patients. We varied the measurement of PPP, plus performed cohort restriction and stratification. We modeled risk differences with two-stage least square regression. First-stage partial r2 values characterized the strength of the instrument. The Mahalanobis distance summarized balance across multiple covariates.
Results: Partial r2 ranged from 0.028 to 0.099. PPP generally alleviated imbalances in nonpsychiatry-related patient characteristics, and the overall imbalance was reduced by an average of 36\% (640\%) over the two cohorts.
Conclusion: In our study setting, most of the 25 formulations of the PPP IV were strong IVs and resulted in a strong reduction of imbalance in many variations. The association between strength and imbalance was mixed. {\'O} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We also consider the relative bias of estimators when the instruments are invalid, i.e. the instruments are correlated with the stochastic disturbance. Here, both 2SLS and OLS are biased in finite samples and inconsistent. We investigate conditions under which the approximate finite sample bias or the MSE of 2SLS is smaller than the corresponding statistics for the OLS estimator. We again find that 2SLS does better than OLS under a wide range of conditions, which we characterize as functions of observable statistics and one unobservable statistic.},

The intent of this article is to provide researchers with more intuition with respect to how important these factors are from an empirical standpoint. Results: Notably, the simulations indicate a greater potential for inferential error when using IV than OLS in all but the most ideal circumstances. Conclusions: Researchers should be cautious when using IV methods. These methods are valuable in testing for the presence of endogeneity but only under the most ideal circumstances are they likely to produce estimates with less estimation error than OLS.},

  abstract = {Objective: Instrumental variable (IV) analysis may offer a useful approach to the problem of unmeasured confounding in prescription drug research if the IV is: (1) strongly and unbiasedly associated to treatment assignment; and (2) uncorrelated with factors predicting the outcome (key assumptions). Study Design and Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the use of IV methods in prescription drug research to identify the major types of IVs and the evidence for meeting IV assumptions. We searched MEDLINE, OVID, PsychoInfo, EconLit, and economic databases from 1961 to 2009.
Results: We identified 26 studies. Most (n 5 16) were published after 2007. We identified five types of IVs: regional variation (n 5 8), facility-prescribing patterns (n 5 5), physician preference (n 5 8), patient history/financial status (n 5 3), and calendar time (n 5 4). Evidence supporting the validity of IV was inconsistent. All studies addressed the first IV assumption; however, there was no standard for demonstrating that the IV sufficiently predicted treatment assignment. For the second assumption, 23 studies provided explicit argument that IV was uncorrelated with the outcome, and 16 supported argument with empirical evidence.
Conclusions: Use of IV methods is increasing in prescription drug research. However, we did not find evidence of a dominant IV. Future research should develop standards for reporting the validity and strength of IV according to key assumptions. {\'O} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we consider the problem of efficient estimation of the conditional mean of the response variable at the original scale for log-normal linear models. Several existing estimators are reviewed first, including the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, the restricted ML (REML) estimator, the uniformly minimum variance unbiased (UMVU) estimator, and a bias-corrected REML estimator. We then propose two estimators that minimize the asymptotic mean squared error and the asymptotic bias, respectively. A parametric bootstrap procedure is also described to obtain confidence intervals for the proposed estimators. Both the new estimators and the bootstrap procedure are very easy to implement. Comparisons of the estimators using simulation studies suggest that our estimators perform better than the existing ones, and the bootstrap procedure yields confidence intervals with good coverage properties. A real application of estimating the mean sediment discharge is used to illustrate the methodology.},

  abstract = {Background: Econometric modeling of healthcare costs and expenditures has become an important component of decision-making across a wide array of real-world settings. Objectives: The objective of this article is to provide a brief summary of important conceptual and analytical issues involved in econometric healthcare cost modeling. To this end, the article explores: outcome measures typically analyzed in such work; the decision maker's perspective in econometric cost modeling exercises; specific analytical issues in econometric model specification; statistical goodness-of-fit testing; empirical implications of ``upper tail'' (or ``high cost'') phenomena; and issues relating to the reporting of findings. Data: Some of the concepts explored here are illustrated in light of samples drawn from the 2005 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the 2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Results and Conclusions: Analysts of healthcare cost data have at their disposal an increasingly sophisticated tool kit for analyzing such data that can in principle and in fact yield increasingly interesting insights into data structures. Yet for such analyses to usefully inform policy decisions, the manner in which such studies are designed, undertaken, and reported must accommodate considerations relevant to the decision-making community. The article concludes with some preliminary thoughts on how such bridges might be constructed.},

Although the response is multivariate, the main interest is in comparing the marginal probabilities between the groups. Estimating the size of these differences under strong error control allows for a better evaluation of effects than can be provided by multiplicity adjusted P-values. Simultaneous confidence intervals for the differences in marginal probabilities are developed through inverting the maximum of correlated Wald, score or quasi-score statistics. Taking advantage of the available correlation information leads to improvements in the joint coverage probability and power compared to straightforward Bonferroni adjustments. Estimating the correlation under the null is also explored. While computationally complex even in small dimensions, it does not result in marked improvements. Based on extensive simulation results, a simple approach that uses univariate score statistics together with their estimated correlation is proposed and recommended. All methods are illustrated using data from a vaccine trial that investigated the incidence of four pre-specified adverse events between two groups and with data from the General Social Survey.},

While regression models for a series of counts are well developed, only few methods are discussed for the analysis of moderate to long (e.g. from 20 to 152 observations) binary or binomial time series. This article suggests generalized linear mixed models with autocorrelated random effects for a parameter-driven approach to such series. We use a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to jointly obtain maximum likelihood estimates of regression parameters and variance components. The likelihood approach, although computationally extensive, allows estimation of marginal joint probabilities of two or more serial events. These are crucial in checking the goodness-of-fit, whether the model adequately captures the serial correlation and for predicting future responses. The model is flexible enough to allow for missing observations or unequally spaced time intervals. We illustrate our approach and model assessment tools with an analysis of the series of winners in the traditional boat race between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, re-evaluating a long-held belief about the effect of the weight of the crew on the odds of winning. We also show how our methods are useful in modeling trends based on the General Social Survey database.},

We propose an interesting EM algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood for generalized linear mixed t-link models for correlated binary data. In contrast with recent developments (Tan et al., 2007; Meza et al., 2009), this algorithm uses closed-form expressions at the E-step, as opposed to Monte Carlo simulation. Our proposed algorithm rely on available formulas for the mean and variance of a truncated multivariate t-distribution. To illustrate the new methodology, a real data set on respiratory infection in children and a simulation study are presented.},

  volume = {2},
  issn = {14654644, 14684357},
  abstract = {Recent advances in statistical software have led to the rapid diffusion of new methods for modelling longitudinal data. Multilevel (also known as hierarchical or random effects) models for binary outcomes have generally been based on a logistic\textendash{}normal specification, by analogy with earlier work for normally distributed data. The appropriate application and interpretation of these models remains somewhat unclear, especially when compared with the computationally more straightforward semiparametric or `marginal' modelling (GEE) approaches. In this paper we pose two interrelated questions. First, what limits should be placed on the interpretation of the coefficients and inferences derived from random-effect models involving binary outcomes? Second, what diagnostic checks are appropriate for evaluating whether such random-effect models provide adequate fits to the data? We address these questions by means of an extended case study using data on adolescent smoking from a large cohort study. Bayesian estimation methods are used to fit a discrete-mixture alternative to the standard logistic\textendash{}normal model, and posterior predictive checking is used to assess model fit. Surprising parallels in the parameter estimates from the logistic\textendash{}normal and mixture models are described and used to question the interpretability of the socalled `subject-specific' regression coefficients from the standard multilevel approach. Posterior predictive checks suggest a serious lack of fit of both multilevel models. The results do not provide final answers to the two questions posed, but we expect that lessons learned from the case study will provide general guidance for further investigation of these important issues.},

Data analysis may include modeling both the marginal response probabilities (i.e., risk) and the dependence structure between pairs of responses (i.e., aggregation). While second-order generalized estimating equations (GEE2) is a well-known approach for such data, alternating logistic regressions (ALR) is a computationally efficient alternative method, especially for large clusters. We illustrate ALR with an application to caries aggregation using a dataset with 3 levels of nesting: tooth surfaces within an interproximal (IP) region, IP regions within a jaw, and jaws within a subject. Caries lesions appear to aggregate strongly within subjects with a spatially distributed risk. The minimum within-IP-region odds ratio (OR) was 2.25 (95\% confidence interval 1.15, 4.41), and the within-IP-region ORs were always greater than the between-IP-region ORs. ALR is a convenient and useful regression technique for explicit modeling of the dependence structure, and may be applicable to other dental research problems involving clustered or nested responses.},

  abstract = {Propensity score approaches in outcomes and epidemiological research are most often used for sample selection by matching, analysis of causal effect by stratification, or risk adjustment by combining propensity score and regression models. Several computing tools are available including SAS, S-PLUS/R, and SPSS to develop and implement propensity score approaches in a variety of applications. This paper reviews the history, statistical definitions, and application of the propensity score in non-randomized observational studies, pre-estimation for randomized designs, and poorly randomized experiments. Several distinct propensity score matching methods, both simple and sophisticated are described in detail to enable users to choose the most appropriate solutions to fit their study objectives. Special cases of propensity score applications discussed include multi-treatment studies, multi-control designs, and missing data processing, where the definitions, estimations and utilization of propensity scores are far different from the general, treatment-control approach. Finally, a discussion of the limitations of propensity score applications in health services and pharmaceutical outcomes research is included.},

  abstract = {The popularity of matching techniques has increased considerably during the last decades. They are mainly used for matching treatment and control units in order to estimate causal treatment effects from observational studies or for integrating two or more data sets that share a common subset of covariates. In focusing on causal inference with observational studies, we discuss multivariate matching techniques and several propensity score methods, like propensity score matching, subclassification, inverse-propensity weighting, and regression estimation. In addition to the theoretical aspects, we give practical guidelines for implementing these techniques and discuss the conditions under which these techniques warrant a causal interpretation of the estimated treatment effect. In particular, we emphasize that the selection of covariates and their reliable measurement is more important than the choice of a specific matching strategy.},

However, it is well known that this formula can lead to serious instabilities in the presence of roundoff error. If the system matrix is symmetric positive definite, it is almost always possible to use a representation based on the Cholesky decomposition which renders the same results (in exact arithmetic) at the same or less operational cost, but typically is much more numerically stable. In this note, we show how the Cholesky decomposition can be updated to incorporate low rank additions or downdated for low rank subtractions. We also discuss a special case of an indefinite update of rank two. The methods discussed here are well-known in the numerical mathematics literature, and code for most of them can be found in the LINPACK suite.},

In particular, one can obtain a positive definite banded estimator of the covariance matrix at the same computational cost as the popular banded estimator of Bickel \& Levina (2008b), which is not guaranteed to be positive definite. We also establish theoretical connections between banding Cholesky factors of the covariance matrix and its inverse and constrained maximum likelihood estimation under the banding constraint, and compare the numerical performance of several methods in simulations and on a sonar data example.},

  abstract = {Finding an unconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization of a covariance matrix is still an open problem in statistics. Its solution is of central importance in covariance estimation, particularly in the recent high-dimensional data environment where enforcing the positive-definiteness constraint could be computationally expensive. We provide a survey of the progress made in modeling covariance matrices from the perspectives of generalized linear models (GLM) or parsimony and use of covariates in low dimensions, regularization (shrinkage, sparsity) for high-dimensional data, and the role of various matrix factorizations. A viable and emerging regressionbased setup which is suitable for both the GLM and the regularization approaches is to link a covariance matrix, its inverse or their factors to certain regression models and then solve the relevant (penalized) least squares problems. We point out several instances of this regression-based setup in the literature. A notable case is in the Gaussian graphical models where linear regressions with LASSO penalty are used to estimate the neighborhood of one node at a time (Meinshausen and Bu\textasciidieresis{}hlmann, 2006). Some advantages and a limitation of the regression-based Cholesky decomposition (Pourahmadi, 1999) relative to the classical spectral (eigenvalue) and variance-correlation decompositions are highlighted. It provides an unconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization, and guarantees the positive-definiteness of the estimated covariance at no additional computational cost, and reduces the unintuitive task of covariance estimation to that of modeling a sequence of regressions. However, its flexibility comes at the cost of imposing an a priori order among the variables in a random vector, so that the above problem is solved for time series, longitudinal, functional and spectroscopic data where the variables are naturally ordered, but for the general multivariate data where the variables are unordered it is still open.},

The use of singular value decomposition as an alternative to the widely known cross-product matrix approach as formed one of the basis of discussion in this paper. However, the use of cross product matrix have placed a lot of restrictions on the user of this technique which makes it difficult to estimate parameter values when the predictor variables seem to be highly correlated, this is often the case when Collinearity (Multi-collinearity) exists among the predictor variables. The consequence of this is that certain conditions that makes the cross product matrix applicable are not satisfied, hence the singular value decomposition approach enables users to resolve this difficult.

Inequality constraints are implicitly used in the testing of commonly applied structural equation models, such as the common factor model, the autoregressive model, and the latent growth curve model, although this is not commonly acknowledged. Such constraints are the result of the null hypothesis in which the parameter value or values are placed on the boundary of the parameter space. For instance, this occurs in testing whether the variance of a growth parameter is significantly different from 0. It is shown that in these cases, the asymptotic distribution of the chi-square difference cannot be treated as that of a central chi-square-distributed random variable with degrees of freedom equal to the number of constraints. The correct distribution for testing 1 or a few parameters at a time is inferred for the 3 structural equation models mentioned above. Subsequently, the authors describe and illustrate the steps that one should take to obtain this distribution. An important message is that using the correct distribution may lead to appreciably greater statistical power.},

  abstract = {Cluster analysis of ranking data, which occurs in consumer questionnaires, voting forms or other inquiries of preferences, attempts to identify typical groups of rank choices. Empirically measured rankings are often incomplete, i.e. different numbers of filled rank positions cause heterogeneity in the data. We propose a mixture approach for clustering of heterogeneous rank data. Rankings of different lengths can be described and compared by means of a single probabilistic model. A maximum entropy approach avoids hidden assumptions about missing rank positions. Parameter estimators and an efficient EM algorithm for unsupervised inference are derived for the ranking mixture model. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate significantly improved parameter estimates on heterogeneous data when the incomplete rankings are included in the inference process.},

  title = {An {{R}} Package for Analyzing and Modeling Ranking Data},
  abstract = {Background: In medical informatics, psychology, market research and many other fields, researchers often need to analyze and model ranking data. However, there is no statistical software that provides tools for the comprehensive analysis of ranking data. Here, we present pmr, an R package for analyzing and modeling ranking data with a bundle of tools. The pmr package enables descriptive statistics (mean rank, pairwise frequencies, and marginal matrix), Analytic Hierarchy Process models (with Saaty's and Koczkodaj's inconsistencies), probability models (Luce model, distance-based model, and rank-ordered logit model), and the visualization of ranking data with multidimensional preference analysis.
Results: Examples of the use of package pmr are given using a real ranking dataset from medical informatics, in which 566 Hong Kong physicians ranked the top five incentives (1: competitive pressures; 2: increased savings; 3: government regulation; 4: improved efficiency; 5: improved quality care; 6: patient demand; 7: financial incentives) to the computerization of clinical practice. The mean rank showed that item 4 is the most preferred item and item 3 is the least preferred item, and significance difference was found between physicians' preferences with respect to their monthly income. A multidimensional preference analysis identified two dimensions that explain 42\% of the total variance. The first can be interpreted as the overall preference of the seven items (labeled as ``internal/ external''), and the second dimension can be interpreted as their overall variance of (labeled as ``push/pull factors''). Various statistical models were fitted, and the best were found to be weighted distance-based models with Spearman's footrule distance.
Conclusions: In this paper, we presented the R package pmr, the first package for analyzing and modeling ranking data. The package provides insight to users through descriptive statistics of ranking data. Users can also visualize ranking data by applying a thought multidimensional preference analysis. Various probability models for ranking data are also included, allowing users to choose that which is most suitable to their specific situations.},

New specifications for exponential random graph models. Sociological Methodology] and demonstrates their improvement over homogeneous Markov random graph models in fitting empirical network data. Not only do the new specifications show improvements in goodness of fit for various data sets, but they also help to avoid the problem of neardegeneracy that often afflicts the fitting of Markov random graph models in practice, particularly to network data exhibiting high levels of transitivity. The inclusion of a new higher order transitivity statistic allows estimation of parameters of exponential graph models for many (but not all) cases where it is impossible to estimate parameters of homogeneous Markov graph models. The new specifications were used to model a large number of classical small-scale network data sets and showed a dramatically better performance than Markov graph models. We also review three current programs for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and we compare these Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimates with less accurate pseudo-likelihood estimates. Finally, we discuss whether homogeneous Markov random graph models may be superseded by the new specifications, and how additional elaborations may further improve model performance.},

A penalized regression approach is adopted in which tensor product smooths of several variables are constructed from smooths of each variable separately, these "marginal" smooths being represented using a low-rank basis with an associated quadratic wiggliness penalty. The smooths offer several advantages: (i) they have one wiggliness penalty per covariate and are hence invariant to linear rescaling of covariates, making them useful when there is no "natural" way to scale covariates relative to each other; (ii) they have a useful tuneable range of smoothness, unlike single-penalty tensor product smooths that are scale invariant; (iii) the relatively low rank of the smooths means that they are computationally efficient; (iv) the penalties on the smooths are easily interpretable in terms of function shape; (v) the smooths can be generated completely automatically from any marginal smoothing bases and associated quadratic penalties, giving the modeler considerable flexibility to choose the basis penalty combination most appropriate to each modeling task; and (vi) the smooths can easily be written as components of a standard linear or generalized linear mixed model, allowing them to be used as components of the rich family of such models implemented in standard software, and to take advantage of the efficient and stable computational methods that have been developed for such models. A small simulation study shows that the methods can compare favorably with recently developed smoothing spline ANOVA methods.},

The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with `knot placement' that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

  abstract = {We examine a generalized F -test of a nonparametric function through penalized splines and a linear mixed effects model representation. With a mixed effects model representation of penalized splines, we imbed the test of an unspecified function into a test of some fixed effects and a variance component in a linear mixed effects model with nuisance variance components under the null. The procedure can be used to test a nonparametric function or varying-coefficient with clustered data, compare two spline functions, test the significance of an unspecified function in an additive model with multiple components, and test a row or a column effect in a two-way analysis of variance model. Through a spectral decomposition of the residual sum of squares, we provide a fast algorithm for computing the null distribution of the test, which significantly improves the computational efficiency over bootstrap. The spectral representation reveals a connection between the likelihood ratio test (LRT) in a multiple variance components model and a single component model. We examine our methods through simulations, where we show that the power of the generalized F -test may be higher than the LRT, depending on the hypothesis of interest and the true model under the alternative. We apply these methods to compute the genome-wide critical value and p-value of a genetic association test in a genome-wide association study (GWAS), where the usual bootstrap is computationally intensive (up to 108 simulations) and asymptotic approximation may be unreliable and conservative.},

This link is more powerful than previously established mixed model representations of semiparametric regression, as a larger class of models can be accommodated.

Directed acyclic graphs, also known as Bayesian networks, play a prominent role. Graphical model-based Bayesian `inference engines', such as BUGS and VIBES, facilitate fitting and inference.

  title = {The Analysis of Designed Experiments and Longitudinal Data Using Smoothing Splines},
  abstract = {Smoothing splines and other non-parametric smoothing methods are well accepted for exploratory data analysis. These methods have been used in regression, in repeated measures or longitudinal data analysis, and in generalized linear models. However, a major drawback is the lack of a formal inferential framework. An exception which has not been fully exploited is the cubic smoothing spline. The cubic smoothing spline admits a mixed model formulation, which places this non-parametric smoother firmly in a parametric setting. The formulation presented in this paper provides the mechanism for including cubic smoothing splines in models for the analysis of designed experiments and longitudinal data. Thus nonlinear curves can be included with random effects and random coefficients, and this leads to very flexible and informative modelling within the linear mixed model framework. Variance heterogeneity can also be accommodated. The advantage of using the cubic smoothing spline in the case of longitudinal data is particularly pronounced, because covariance modelling is achieved implicitly as for random coefficient models. Several examples are considered to illustrate the ideas.},

Compared with extant pedagogic material, greater care is placed on motivating the definition of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and explaining when and why these spaces are efficacious. The novel viewpoint is that reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory studies extrinsic geometry, associating with each geometric configuration a canonical overdetermined coordinate system. This coordinate system varies continuously with changing geometric configurations, making it well-suited for studying problems whose solutions also vary continuously with changing geometry. This primer can also serve as an introduction to infinite-dimensional linear algebra because reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have more properties in common with Euclidean spaces than do more general Hilbert spaces.},

Decompositions of higher-order tensors (i.e., AT-way arrays with N {$>$} 3) have applications metrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer in psycho vision, nu merical analysis, data mining, neuroscience, graph analysis, and elsewhere. Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix sin gular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative vari ants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors.},

Quantile Boost Regression performs gradient descent in functional space to minimize the objective function used by quantile regression (QReg). In the classification scenario, the class label is defined via a hidden variable, and the quantiles of the class label are estimated by fitting the corresponding quantiles of the hidden variable. An equivalent form of the definition of quantile is introduced, whose smoothed version is employed as the objective function, and then maximized by functional gradient ascent to obtain the Quantile Boost Classification algorithm. Extensive experimentation and detailed analysis show that QBoost performs better than the original QReg and other alternatives for regression and binary classification. Furthermore, QBoost is capable of solving problems in high dimensional space and is more robust to noisy predictors.},

  abstract = {The multi-label classification problem has generated significant interest in recent years. However, existing approaches do not adequately address two key challenges: (a) the ability to tackle problems with a large number (say millions) of labels, and (b) the ability to handle data with missing labels. In this paper, we directly address both these problems by studying the multi-label problem in a generic empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our framework, despite being simple, is surprisingly able to encompass several recent label-compression based methods which can be derived as special cases of our method. To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the structure of specific loss functions - such as the squared loss function - to offer efficient algorithms. We further show that our learning framework admits formal excess risk bounds even in the presence of missing labels. Our risk bounds are tight and demonstrate better generalization performance for low-rank promoting trace-norm regularization when compared to (rank insensitive) Frobenius norm regularization. Finally, we present extensive empirical results on a variety of benchmark datasets and show that our methods perform significantly better than existing label compression based methods and can scale up to very large datasets such as the Wikipedia dataset.},

We propose to use Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) to choose between node types in omnivariate decision tree construction to match the complexity of a node to the complexity of the data reaching that node. In order to apply SRM for model selection, one needs the VC-dimension of the candidate models. In this paper, we first derive the VC-dimension of the univariate model, and estimate the VC-dimension of all three models (univariate, linear multivariate or quadratic multivariate) experimentally. Second, we compare SRM with other model selection techniques including Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and cross-validation (CV) on standard datasets from the UCI and Delve repositories. We see that SRM induces omnivariate trees that have a small percentage of multivariate nodes close to the root and they generalize more or at least as accurately as those constructed using other model selection techniques.},

With weighted estimating equations, the contribution to the estimating equation from a complete observation is weighted by the inverse of the probability of being observed. We propose a test statistic to assess if the weighted estimating equations produce biased estimates. Our test statistic is similar to the test statistic proposed by DuMouchel and Duncan (1983) for weighted least squares estimates for sample survey data. The method is illustrated using data from a randomized clinical trial on chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.},

Survey weights adjust for oversampling and nonresponse on a cross-sectional basis. A significant portion of the sample (e.g., 60\% on 3 or more surveys from 1993-2006) appears in multiple survey years and can be linked across time. No longitudinal weight exists that would enable estimation of statistical models or comparison of finite population characteristics using data from multiple survey waves together. This paper explores calibration estimation for construction of such a longitudinal weight. Three requirements are considered when producing longitudinal weights. First, the weight needs to be calculable from existing data, which means either the public use data sets or the restricted use versions that NSF releases under strict licensing. Second, the weight needs to be useful for reproducing key crosssectional analyses. This is both a requirement for consistency and an attempt to produce advantages in estimation via correlations. Third, the weight should be low in variability, because high variability weights are associated with low precision in estimation. Choices of initial weights and calibration targets are compared in a series of analyses.},

However, survey estimates are subject to coverage bias if sampled persons with Internet access are systematically different from those without Internet access who were excluded from the survey. Statistical adjustments, either through weighting or modeling methods, can minimize or even eliminate bias due to noncoverage. In the current paper, we examine the coverage bias associated with conducting a hypothetical Internet survey on a frame of persons obtained through a random-digit-dial sample. We compare estimates collected during telephone interviews from households with and without Internet access using data from the 2003 Michigan Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in the United States. A total of 25 binary variables (e.g., the percent of adults who have asthma or who are classified as being obese) and four count variables (e.g., the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per month) were analyzed for this study in addition to eight demographic characteristics. Weights based on the general regression estimator are computed such that the coverage bias is reduced to undetectable levels for most of the health outcomes analyzed from the Michigan survey. Though not definitive, the analysis results suggest that statistical adjustments can reduce, if not eliminate, coverage bias in the situation we study.},

This paper first compares several different methods\textemdash{}predictive value imputation, the distributionbased imputation used by C4.5, and using reduced models\textemdash{}for applying classification trees to instances with missing values (and also shows evidence that the results generalize to bagged trees and to logistic regression). The results show that for the two most popular treatments, each is preferable under different conditions. Strikingly the reduced-models approach, seldom mentioned or used, consistently outperforms the other two methods, sometimes by a large margin. The lack of attention to reduced modeling may be due in part to its (perceived) expense in terms of computation or storage. Therefore, we then introduce and evaluate alternative, hybrid approaches that allow users to balance between more accurate but computationally expensive reduced modeling and the other, less accurate but less computationally expensive treatments. The results show that the hybrid methods can scale gracefully to the amount of investment in computation/storage, and that they outperform imputation even for small investments.},

Although spline-based statistical algorithms tend to have good accuracy, they also require relatively long training times. Polyclass, for example, is third last in terms of median training time. It often requires hours of training compared to seconds for other algorithms. The Quest and logistic regression algorithms are substantially faster. Among decision tree algorithms with univariate splits, C4.5, Ind-Cart, and Quest have the best combinations of error rate and speed. But C4.5 tends to produce trees with twice as many leaves as those from Ind-Cart and Quest.},

The technique is a variation of the approach of Segal (1992) for longitudinal data. It has the potential to be applied to many different types of problems in which analysts want to predict the simultaneous cooccurrence of several dependent variables. Multivariate regression trees can also be used as an alternative to cluster analysis in situations where clusters are defined by a set of independent variables and the researcher wants clusters as homogeneous as possible with respect to a group of dependent variables.},

  abstract = {There are many different methods used by classification tree algorithms when missing data occur in the predictors, but few studies have been done comparing their appropriateness and performance. This paper provides both analytic and Monte Carlo evidence regarding the effectiveness of six popular missing data methods for classification trees applied to binary response data. We show that in the context of classification trees, the relationship between the missingness and the dependent variable, as well as the existence or non-existence of missing values in the testing data, are the most helpful criteria to distinguish different missing data methods. In particular, separate class is clearly the best method to use when the testing set has missing values and the missingness is related to the response variable. A real data set related to modeling bankruptcy of a firm is then analyzed. The paper concludes with discussion of adaptation of these results to logistic regression, and other potential generalizations.},

Existing approaches to LSDR, such as compressive sensing and principal label space transformation, exploit only the label part of the dataset, but not the feature part. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to LSDR that considers both the label and the feature parts. The approach, called conditional principal label space transformation, is based on minimizing an upper bound of the popular Hamming loss. The minimization step of the approach can be carried out efficiently by a simple use of singular value decomposition. In addition, the approach can be extended to a kernelized version that allows the use of sophisticated feature combinations to assist LSDR. The experimental results verify that the proposed approach is more effective than existing ones to LSDR across many real-world datasets.},

Predictive accuracy, a popular choice for evaluatingperformanceof a classifier, might not be appropriatewhen the data is imbalanced andlor the costs of different errors vary markedly.

Nevertheless, statistical inference based on full likelihood and Bayesian methods is not available in most statistical software, largely because the distribution has an intractable density function and numerical methods that allow fast and accurate evaluation of the density did not appear until fairly recently. The cplm package provides likelihood-based and Bayesian procedures for fitting common Tweedie compound Poisson linear models. In particular, models with hierarchical structures, penalized splines or extra zero inflation can be handled. Further, the package implements the Gini index based on an ordered version of the Lorenz curve as a robust model comparison tool involving zero-inflated and highly skewed distributions.},

It provides a valuable opportunity to examine the development and progression of CAC (coronary artery calcium), which is an important risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease. In MESA, about half of the CAC scores are zero and the rest are continuously distributed. Such data has been referred to as ``zero-inflated data'' and may be described using two-part models. Existing two-part model studies have limitations in that they usually consider parametric models only, make the assumption of known forms of the covariate effects, and focus only on the estimation property of the models. In this article, we investigate statistical modeling of CAC in MESA. Building on existing studies, we focus on two-part models. We investigate both parametric and semiparametric, and both proportional and nonproportional models. For various models, we study their estimation as well as prediction properties. We show that, to fully describe the relationship between covariates and CAC development, the semiparametric model with nonproportional covariate effects is needed. In contrast, for the purpose of prediction, the parametric model with proportional covariate effects is sufficient. This study provides a statistical basis for describing the behaviors of CAC and insights into its biological mechanisms.},

Both partially constrained and unconstrained models are considered to investigate the underlying biological processes of CAC development from zero to positive, and from small amount to large amount. Different from existing studies, a model selection procedure based on likelihood cross-validation is adopted to identify the optimal model, which is justified by comparative Monte Carlo studies. A shrinkaged version of cubic regression spline is used for model estimation and variable selection simultaneously. When applying the proposed methods to the MESA data analysis, we show that the two biological mechanisms influencing the initiation of CAC and the magnitude of CAC when it is positive are better characterized by an unconstrained zero-inflated normal model. Our results are significantly different from those in published studies, and may provide further insights into the biological mechanisms underlying CAC development in human. This highly flexible statistical framework can be applied to zero-inflated data analyses in other areas.},

  abstract = {The popular cubic smoothing spline estimate of a regression function arises as the minimizer of the penalized sum of squares \$\textbackslash{}sum\_j(Y\_j - \{\textbackslash{}mu\}(t\_j))\^2 + \{\textbackslash{}lambda\}\textbackslash{}int\_a\^b [\{\textbackslash{}mu\}"(t)]\^2 dt\$, where the data are \$t\_j,Y\_j\$, \$j=1,..., n\$. The minimization is taken over an infinite-dimensional function space, the space of all functions with square integrable second derivatives. But the calculations can be carried out in a finite-dimensional space. The reduction from minimizing over an infinite dimensional space to minimizing over a finite dimensional space occurs for more general objective functions: the data may be related to the function \$\{\textbackslash{}mu\}\$ in another way, the sum of squares may be replaced by a more suitable expression, or the penalty, \$\textbackslash{}int\_a\^b [\{\textbackslash{}mu\}"(t)]\^2 dt\$, might take a different form. This paper reviews the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space structure that provides a finite-dimensional solution for a general minimization problem. Particular attention is paid to penalties based on linear differential operators. In this case, one can sometimes easily calculate the minimizer explicitly, using Green's functions.},

Equidistant knots can be used, but their small and discrete number allows only limited control over smoothness and fit. We propose to use a relatively large number of knots and a difference penalty on coefficients of adjacent B-splines. We show connections to the familiar spline penalty on the integral of the squared second derivative. A short overview of Bsplines, of their construction and of penalized likelihood is presented. We discuss properties of penalized B-splines and propose various criteria for the choice of an optimal penalty parameter. Nonparametric logistic regression, density estimation and scatterplot smoothing are used as examples. Some details of the computations are presented.},

The proposed semiparametric model can be viewed as a sensitivity analysis for model misspecification of the missing covariate distribution and/or missing data mechanism. The semiparametric model consists of a generalized additive model (GAM) for the covariate distribution and/or missing data mechanism. Penalized regression splines are used to express the GAMs as a generalized linear mixed effects model, in which the variance of the corresponding random effects provides an intuitive index for choosing between the semiparametric and parametric model. Maximum likelihood estimates are then obtained via the EM algorithm. Simulations are given to demonstrate the methodology, and a real data set from a melanoma cancer clinical trial is analyzed using the proposed methods.},

The models are also useful for imputation of missing data and exploratory analysis of variance. We prove that the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUP) from the extended mixed e ects model correspond to solutions of a generalized penalized regression where smoothing parameters are directly related to variance components, and we show that these solutions are natural cubic splines. The model parameters are estimated using a highly e cient implementation of the EM algorithm for restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation based on a preliminary eigenvector decomposition. Variability of computed estimates can be assessed with asymptotic techniques or with a novel hierarchical bootstrap resampling scheme for nested mixed e ects models. Our methods are applied to menstrual cycle data from studies of reproductive function that measure daily urinary progesterone; the sample of progesterone curves is strati ed by cycles nested within subjects nested within conceptive and non-conceptive groups.},

Although theoretical foundations of copulas are complex, this paper demonstrates that practical implementation and estimation are relatively straightforward. An attractive feature of parametrically specified copulas is that estimation and inference are based on standard maximum likelihood procedures, and thus copulas can be estimated using desktop econometric software. This represents a substantial advantage of copulas over recently proposed simulationbased approaches to joint modeling.},

This is due to the fact that the similarity of node attributes in social networks decreases as a function of the graph distance. An epidemic model on a scale-free network with this property has a finite threshold, implying that the spread of information is limited. We tested our predictions by measuring the spread of messages in an organization and also by numerical experiments that take into consideration the organizational distance among individuals.},

Importance sampling formulas take on an easy form relating to the deviance in exponential families, and are particularly simple starting from Jeffreys invariant prior. Because of the i.i.d. nature of bootstrap sampling, familiar formulas describe the computational accuracy of the Bayes estimates. Besides computational methods, the theory provides a connection between Bayesian and frequentist analysis. Efficient algorithms for the frequentist accuracy of Bayesian inferences are developed and demonstrated in a model selection example.},

  issn = {01679473},
  abstract = {The multinomial probit model has emerged as a useful framework for modeling nominal categorical data, but extending such models to multivariate measures presents computational challenges. Following a Bayesian paradigm, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to analyze multivariate nominal measures through multivariate multinomial probit models. As with a univariate version of the model, identification of model parameters requires restrictions on the covariance matrix of the latent variables that are introduced to define the probit specification. To sample the covariance matrix with restrictions within the MCMC procedure, we use a parameter-extended MetropolisHastings algorithm that incorporates artificial variance parameters to transform the problem into a set of simpler tasks including sampling an unrestricted covariance matrix. The parameter-extended algorithm also allows for flexible prior distributions on covariance matrices. The prior specification in the method described here generalizes earlier approaches to analyzing univariate nominal data, and the multivariate correlation structure in the method described here generalizes the autoregressive structure proposed in previous multiperiod multinomial probit models. Our methodology is illustrated through a simulated example and an application to a cancer-control study aiming to achieve early detection of breast cancer.},

Models may be specified either textually via the BUGS language or pictorially using a graphical interface called DoodleBUGS. WinBUGS processes the model specification and constructs an object-oriented representation of the model. The software offers a user-interface, based on dialogue boxes and menu commands, through which the model may then be analysed using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper we discuss how and why various modern computing concepts, such as object-orientation and run-time linking, feature in the software's design. We also discuss how the framework may be extended. It is possible to write specific applications that form an apparently seamless interface with WinBUGS for users with specialized requirements. It is also possible to interface with WinBUGS at a lower level by incorporating new object types that may be used by WinBUGS without knowledge of the modules in which they are implemented. Neither of these types of extension require access to, or even recompilation of, the WinBUGS source-code.},

  volume = {71},
  issn = {13697412, 14679868},
  abstract = {Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or motecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defimes another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states ("annealing"), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel "relaxation" algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

No random sampling of units is involved. In biological work, random sampling is frequently unavoidable, in which case the joint distribution p.y, x/ depends on the sampling scheme. Regression models can be used for the study of dependence provided that the conditional distribution p.yjx/ for random samples agrees with px.y/ as determined by the regression model for a fixed sample having a non-random configuration x. The paper develops a model that avoids the concept of a fixed population of units, thereby forcing the sampling plan to be incorporated into the sampling distribution. For a quota sample having a predetermined covariate configuration x, the sampling distribution agrees with the standard logistic regression model with correlated components. For most natural sampling plans such as sequential or simple random sampling, the conditional distribution p.yjx/ is not the same as the regression distribution unless px.y/ has independent components. In this sense, most natural sampling schemes involving binary random-effects models are biased.The implications of this formulation for subject-specific and population-averaged procedures are explored.},

  abstract = {The comparison of groups in regression models for binary outcomes is complicated by an identification problem inherent in these models. Traditional tests of the equality of coefficients across groups confound the magnitude of the regression coefficients with residual variation. If the amount of residual variation differs between groups, the test can lead to incorrect conclusions (Allison 1999). Allison proposes a test for the equality of regression coefficients that removes the effect of group differences in residual variation by adding the assumption that the regression coefficients for some variables are identical across groups. In practice, a researcher is unlikely to have either empirical or theoretical justification for this assumption, in which case the Allison's test can also lead to incorrect conclusions. An alternative approach, suggested here, uses predicted probabilities. Since predicted probabilities are unaffected by residual variation, tests of the equality of predicted probabilities across groups can be used for group comparisons without assuming the equality of the regression coefficients of some variables. Using predicted probabilities requires researchers to think differently about comparing groups. With tests of the equality of regression coefficients, a single test lets the researcher conclude easily whether the effects of a variable are equal across groups. Testing the equality of predicted probabilities requires multiple tests since group differences in predictions vary with the levels of the variables in the model. A researcher must examine group differences in predictions at multiple levels of the variables often requiring more complex conclusions on how groups differ in the effect of a variable.},

Two parametric families of link functions are investigated: the Gosset link based on the Student t latent variable model with the degrees of freedom parameter controlling the tail behavior, and the Pregibon link based on the (generalized) Tukey {$\lambda$} family with two shape parameters controlling skewness and tail behavior. Both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods for estimation and inference are explored, compared and contrasted. In applications, like the propensity score matching problem discussed in Section 4, where it is critical to have accurate estimates of the conditional probabilities, we find that misspecification of the link function can create serious bias. Bayesian point estimation via MCMC performs quite competitively with MLE methods; however nominal coverage of Bayes credible regions is somewhat more problematic.},

To achieve such a goal, marginal models with bivariate log odds ratio and univariate logit components are extended to include random effects for all components. Specifically, separate normal random effects are specified on the log odds ratio scale for bivariate responses and on the logit scale for univariate responses. Assuming conditional independence given the random effects facilitates the modeling of bivariate associations across time with missing at random incomplete data. We fit the model to a dataset for which such structures are feasible: a longitudinal randomized trial of a cardiovascular educational program where the responses of interest are change in hypertension and hypercholestemia status. The proposed model is compared to a naive bivariate model that assumes independence between time points and univariate mixed effects logit models.},

The model is a multivariate generalization of the model for univariate longitudinal data given by Taylor, Cumberland, and Sy (1994, Journal of the American Statistical Association 89, 727-736). The stochastic process used in this paper is the multivariate integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, which includes Brownian motion and a random effects model as special limiting cases. This process is an underlying continuous-time autoregressive order [AR(1)] process for the derivatives of the multivariate observations. The model allows unequally spaced observations and missing values for some of the variables. We analyze CD4 T-cell and beta-2-microglobulin measurements of the seroconverters at multiple time points from the Los Angeles section of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. The model allows us to investigate the relationship between CD4 and beta-2-microglobulin through the correlations between their random effects and their serial correlation. The data suggest that CD4 and beta-2-microglobulin follow a bivariate Brownian motion process. The fit of the model implies that an increase in beta2-microglobulin is associated with a decrease in future CD4 but not vice versa, agreeing with immunologic postulates about the relationship between these two variables.},

Association models can be applied when an underlying bivariate normal is assumed and also under more general conditions, and they provide alternatives to tetrachoric and polychoric correlation. These models agree more closely with the bivariate normal than does Plackett's model (1965), when the row and column classifications arise from underlying univariate normal distributions. The general utility of the association models is illustrated here.},

The procedure they propose is based on the score statistic derived from the assumed copula structure under the alternative. The authors further argue that conditional dependence can be conveniently modelled with meta-elliptical copulas, which offer a wide range of positive and negative degrees of association. They call on a composite likelihood to estimate the copula parameters and they provide standard error estimates of the same via linearization. They illustrate their results with Canadian data on the presence or absence of various log grades in trees.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of separation or monotone likelihood is observed in the {\"y}tting process of a logistic model if the likelihood converges while at least one parameter estimate diverges to {$\pm$} in{\"y}nity. Separation primarily occurs in small samples with several unbalanced and highly predictive risk factors. A procedure by Firth originally developed to reduce the bias of maximum likelihood estimates is shown to provide an ideal solution to separation. It produces {\"y}nite parameter estimates by means of penalized maximum likelihood estimation. Corresponding Wald tests and con{\"y}dence intervals are available but it is shown that penalized likelihood ratio tests and pro{\"y}le penalized likelihood con{\"y}dence intervals are often preferable. The clear advantage of the procedure over previous options of analysis is impressively demonstrated by the statistical analysis of two cancer studies. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we describe the technical implementation of the estimation routine and discuss its properties. Further, we compare our estimation routine with the Stata program gllamm, which solves integration by using Gauss\textendash{}Hermite quadrature or adaptive quadrature. For the analysis, we draw on multilevel data about schooling. Our empirical findings show that the estimation techniques lead to approximately the same estimation results. The advantage of simulation over Gauss\textendash{}Hermite quadrature is a marked reduction in computational time for integrals with higher dimensions. Adaptive quadrature leads to more stable results relative to the other integration methods. However, simulation is more time efficient. We find that maximum simulated likelihood leads to estimation results with reasonable accuracy in roughly half the time required when using adaptive quadrature.},

  abstract = {Logistic regression is one of the most popular techniques used to describe the relationship between a binary dependent variable and a set of independent variables. However, the application of logistic regression to small data sets is often hindered by the complete or quasicomplete separation. Under the separation scenario, results obtained via maximum likelihood should not be trusted, since at least one parameter estimate diverges to infinity. Firth's approach to logistic regression is a theoretically sound procedure, which is guaranteed to arrive at finite estimates even in a separation case. Firth's procedure was also proved to significantly reduce the small sample bias of maximum likelihood estimates. The main goal of the paper is to introduce the STATISTICA macro, which performs Firth-type logistic regression.},

  title = {Individual Behaviour, Space and Predator Evolution Promote Persistence in a Two-Patch System with Predator Switching},
  abstract = {Predator switching is often assumed to be a stabilizing force in predator\textendash{}prey interactions. Recent models, however, have shown that predator switching can have a destabilizing effect on populations, creating cycles or even extinctions of predators and prey. However, most of these models have been traditional top-down mathematical models that do not incorporate individual variability or evolution. We explored the influence of predator switching on predator\textendash{}prey stability, persistence and evolution using an individual-based, spatially explicit model of predators switching between two prey patches. We also created difference equation models for comparison with the simulations. We found that individual variability among predators, and selection acting on switching thresholds, helped in maintaining stability and persistence in our predator\textendash{}prey system. Predators that estimated prey density (with error) or had `short memories' produced more stable population dynamics than predators with perfect knowledge of prey density or had `long memories'. The threshold prey density at which switching occurred evolved in the predator population to be greater than the predicted optimal density. This result led to undermatching of predators to their resources and tended to increase predator\textendash{}prey stability. Furthermore, multiple switching thresholds could be maintained in the predator population at the same time. These results suggest that in an ecological system with individual predators switching between prey species, predator switching may help stabilize predator\textendash{}prey interactions.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, predator switching has been assumed to be a stabilizing force in ecological systems. Recent work, however, has shown that predator switching can be either stabilizing or destabilizing. Most models of predator switching, to date, assume that prey are behaviorally passive and do not respond to predators. We allowed prey to respond behaviorally to predators, so as to avoid capture, in order to explore how this ecologically realistic addition modified the impact of predator switching upon population stability and persistence. We used an individual-based, spatially explicit model that described local interactions between predators and prey, with a probability that prey would ``sense'' predators in adjacent cells and move away from the predators. We compared the individual-based model to a simple difference equation model. We found that intermediate prey sensitivity in the individualbased model allowed the highest probability of persistence of the predator\textendash{}prey system. By allowing prey sensitivity, and the prey density threshold at which predators switch between prey, to evolve, we found that the evolution of sensitivity acted to stabilize the predator\textendash{}prey system. We also found that at large prey growth rates, polymorphism in switching strategies can be stable in the predator population. These results suggest that prey behavior, coupled with predator switching, can have a large impact on the stability, persistence, and heterogeneity of predator\textendash{}prey systems.},

Our explanation of this result is that the dividend amplitude parameter is a measurement of market uncertainty. The greater the uncertainty, the greater the price volatility, and so is the risk of investing in the stock market. The greater the risk, the greater the advantage of including technical rules.},

  abstract = {Current modeling of response times on test items has been strongly influenced by the paradigm of experimental reaction-time research in psychology. For instance, some of the models have a parameter structure that was chosen to represent a speed-accuracy tradeoff, while others equate speed directly with response time. Also, several response-time models seem to be unclear as to the level of parametrization they represent. A hierarchical framework for modeling speed and accuracy on test items is presented as an alternative to these models. The framework allows a ``plug-and-play approach'' with alternative choices of models for the response and response-time distributions as well as the distributions of their parameters. Bayesian treatment of the framework with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation facilitates the approach. Use of the framework is illustrated for the choice of a normal-ogive response model, a lognormal model for the response times, and multivariate normal models for their parameters with Gibbs sampling from the joint posterior distribution.},

Utilizing Gaussian copulas, we present a unified and flexible machinery to integrate separate one-dimensional generalized linear models (GLMs) into a joint regression analysis of continuous, discrete, and mixed correlated outcomes. This essentially leads to a multivariate analogue of the univariate GLM theory and hence an efficiency gain in the estimation of regression coefficients. The availability of joint probability models enables us to develop a full maximum likelihood inference. Numerical illustrations are focused on regression models for discrete correlated data, including multidimensional logistic regression models and a joint model for mixed normal and binary outcomes. In the simulation studies, the proposed copula-based joint model is compared to the popular generalized estimating equations, which is a moment-based estimating equation method to join univariate GLMs. Two real-world data examples are used in the illustration.},

We demonstrate that the BLN model is poorly identified unless proper restrictions are imposed on the parameters. Moreover, estimation of BLN models is unduly computationally complex. In the first application considered by Coull and Agresti, an identification problem results in highly unstable, highly correlated parameter estimates and large standard errors. A probit-normal version of the specified BLN model is demonstrated to be underidentified, whereas the BLN model is empirically underidentified. Identification can be achieved by constraining one of the parameters. We show that a one-factor probit model is equivalent to the probit version of the specified BLN model and that a one-factor logit model is empirically equivalent to the BLN model. Estimation is greatly simplified by using a factor model.},

  abstract = {Applications of copulas for multivariate continuous data abound but there are only a few that treat multivariate binary data. In the present paper, we model multivariate binary data based on copulas using mixtures of max-infinitely divisible copulas, introduced by Joe and Hu (J. Multivar. Anal. 1996; 57(2): 240\textendash{}265). When applying copulas to binary data the marginal distributions also contribute to the dependence measures. We propose the use of covariate information in the copula parameters to obtain a direct effect of a covariate on dependence. To deal with model uncertainty due to selecting among several candidate models, we use a model averaging technique. We apply the model to data from the SignalTandmobiel c dental study and, in particular, to four binary responses that refer to caries experience in the mandibular and maxillary left and right molars. We aim to model Kendall's tau associations between them, and examine how covariate information affects these associations. We found that there are systematically larger associations between the two mandibular and the two maxillary molars. Using covariates to model these associations more closely, we found that the systematic fluoride and age of the children affect the associations.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE \textemdash{} To develop and validate an empirical equation to screen for diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \textemdash{} A predictive equation was developed using multiple logistic regression analysis and data collected from 1,032 Egyptian subjects with no history of diabetes. The equation incorporated age, sex, BMI, postprandial time (self-reported number of hours since last food or drink other than water), and random capillary plasma glucose as independent covariates for prediction of undiagnosed diabetes. These covariates were based on a fasting plasma glucose level Ն126 mg/dl and/or a plasma glucose level 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load Ն200 mg/dl. The equation was validated using data collected from an independent sample of 1,065 American subjects. Its performance was also compared with that of recommended and proposed static plasma glucose cut points for diabetes screening.
RESULTS \textemdash{} The predictive equation was calculated with the following logistic regression parameters: P ϭ 1/(1 Ϫ eϪx), where x ϭ Ϫ10.0382 ϩ [0.0331 (age in years) ϩ 0.0308 (random plasma glucose in mg/dl) ϩ 0.2500 (postprandial time assessed as 0 to Ն8 h) ϩ 0.5620 (if female) ϩ 0.0346 (BMI)]. The cut point for the prediction of previously undiagnosed diabetes was defined as a probability value Ն0.20. The equation's sensitivity was 65\%, specificity 96\%, and positive predictive value (PPV) 67\%. When applied to a new sample, the equation's sensitivity was 62\%, specificity 96\%, and PPV 63\%.
CONCLUSIONS \textemdash{} This multivariate logistic equation improves on currently recommended methods of screening for undiagnosed diabetes and can be easily implemented in a inexpensive handheld programmable calculator to predict previously undiagnosed diabetes.},

In particular, it is examined what criteria are appropriate for adaptive testing in which all abilities are intentional, some should be considered as a nuisance, or the interest is in the testing of a composite of the abilities. Both the theoretical analyses and the studies of simulated data in this paper suggest that the criteria of A-optimality and D-optimality lead to the most accurate estimates when all abilities are intentional, with the former slightly outperforming the latter. The criterion of E-optimality showed occasional erratic behavior for this case of adaptive testing, and its use is not recommended. If some of the abilities are nuisances, application of the criterion of As -optimality (or Ds -optimality), which focuses on the subset of intentional abilities is recommended. For the measurement of a linear combination of abilities, the criterion of c-optimality yielded the best results. The preferences of each of these criteria for items with specific patterns of parameter values was also assessed. It was found that the criteria differed mainly in their preferences of items with different patterns of values for their discrimination parameters.},

Related discussion refers to multi-level and transitional models.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Standard estimation of ordered odds ratios requires the constraint that the etiologic effects of exposure are homogenous across thresholds of the ordered response. We present a method to relax this often-unrealistic constraint.
METHODS: The kernel of the proposed method is the expansion of observed data into ``person-thresholds.'' Using standard statistical software, for each subject we create a separate record for each response threshold and then apply binary logistic regression to estimate generalized cumulative odds ratios for one or more exposures.
RESULTS: Two examples demonstrate that the proposed method provides increased flexibility in assessing the etiologic effects of exposures. A Monte Carlo simulation study supports the proposed approach by suggesting the estimated cumulative odds ratios are unbiased with proper confidence interval coverage attained by use of generalized estimating equations.
CONCLUSION: The proposed method provides simple estimates of ordered odds ratios that allow the etiologic effects of exposure to vary across levels of the ordered response. Ann Epidemiol 2004;14:172\textendash{}178. {\k{a}} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The proportional odds model (POM) is the most popular logistic regression model for analyzing ordinal response variables. However, violation of the main model assumption can lead to invalid results. This is demonstrated by application of this method to data of a study investigating the effect of smoking on diabetic retinopathy. Since the proportional odds assumption is not fulfilled, separate binary logistic regression models are used for dichotomized response variables based upon cumulative probabilities. This approach is compared with polytomous logistic regression and the partial proportional odds model. The separate binary logistic regression approach is slightly less efficient than a joint model for the ordinal response. However, model building, investigating goodness-of-fit, and interpretation of the results is much easier for binary responses. The careful application of separate binary logistic regressions represents a simple and adequate tool to analyze ordinal data with non-proportional odds. j clin epidemiol 51;10:809\textendash{}816, 1998. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.},

When collecting both (binary) responses and (continuous) response times on test items, it is possible to measure the accuracy and speed of test takers. To study the relationships between these two constructs, the model is extended with a multivariate multilevel regression structure which allows the incorporation of covariates to explain the variance in speed and accuracy between individuals and groups of test takers. A Bayesian approach with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation enables straightforward estimation of all model parameters. Model-specific implementations of a Bayes factor (BF) and deviance information criterium (DIC) for model selection are proposed which are easily calculated as byproducts of the MCMC computation. Both results from simulation studies and real-data examples are given to illustrate several novel analyses possible with this modeling framework.},

In response, research efforts are being devoted to the development of tools that assess the sensitivity of such models to often strong but always, at least in part, unverifiable assumptions. Many efforts have been devoted to longitudinal data, primarily in the selection model context, although some researchers have expressed interest in the pattern-mixture setting as well. A promising tool, proposed by Verbeke et al. (2001, Biometrics 57, 43-50), is based on local influence (Cook, 1986, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 48, 133-169). These authors considered the Diggle and Kenward (1994, Applied Statistics 43, 49-93) model, which is based on a selection model, integrating a linear mixed model for continuous outcomes with logistic regression for dropout. In this article, we show that a similar idea can be developed for multivariate and longitudinal binary data, subject to nonmonotone missingness. We focus on the model proposed by Baker, Rosenberger, and DerSimonian (1992, Statistics in Medicine 11, 643-657). The original model is first extended to allow for (possibly continuous) covariates, whereafter a local influence strategy is developed to support the model-building process. The model is able to deal with nonmonotone missingness but has some limitations as well, stemming from the conditional nature of the model parameters. Some analytical insight is provided into the behavior of the local influence graphs.

This seems to be true for univariate binary response models; however, for multivariate binary response models such advice is misleading. We address a gap in the literature by empirically examining the relationship between link function selection and model fit in two classes of multivariate binary response models. We find clear evidence that model fit can be improved by the selection of the appropriate link even in small data sets. In multivariate link function models, the logit link provides better fit in the presence of extreme independent variable levels. Conversely, model fit in random effects models with moderate size data sets is improved generally by selecting the probit link.},

The model allows for estimating the effect of the true value of the covariate on a repeated binary response. The choice of a probit link for the effect of the error-free covariate, coupled with normal measurement error for the error-free covariate, results in a probit model after integrating over the measurement error distribution. We propose a two-stage estimation procedure where, in the first stage, a linear mixed model is used to fit the repeated covariate. In the second stage, a model for the correlated binary responses conditional on the linear mixed model estimates is fit to the repeated binary data using generalized estimating equations. The approach is demonstrated using nutrient safety data from the Diet Intervention of School Age Children (DISC) study.},

This parameterization supports likelihood-based inference for both regression parameters, relating marginal probabilities to explanatory variables, and association model parameters, relating dependence ratios to simple and meaningful mechanisms. Five types of association models are proposed, where responses are (1) independent given a necessary factor for the possibility of a success, (2) independent given a latent binary factor, (3) independent given a latent beta distributed variable, (4) follow a Markov chain, and (5) follow one of two first-order Markov chains depending on the realization of a binary latent factor. These models are illustrated by reanalyzing three data sets, foremost a set of binary time series on auranofin therapy against arthritis. Likelihood-based approaches are contrasted with approaches based on generalized estimating equations. Association models specified by dependence ratios are contrasted with other models for a multivariate binary response that are specified by odds ratios or correlation coefficients.},

The joint probabilities of the subunit responses are expressed as explicit functions of the marginal means and the dependence ratios of all orders, obtaining a computational advantage for likelihood-based inference. Equal emphasis is put on finding regression models for the univariate cumulative probabilities, and on deriving the dependence ratios from meaningful association-generating mechanisms.

We use this distribution to model multivariate binomial-type responses using a vector of random effects. The vector of logits of parameters has a mean that is a linear function of explanatory variables and has an unspecified or partly specified covariance matrix. The model generalizes and provides greater flexibility than the univariate model that uses a normal random effect to account for positive correlations in clustered data. The multivariate model is useful when different elements of the response vector refer to different characteristics, each of which may naturally have its own random effect. It is also useful for repeated binary measurement of a single response when there is a nonexchangeable association structure, such as one often expects with longitudinal data or when negative association exists for at least one pair of responses. We apply the model to an influenza study with repeated responses in which some pairs are negatively associated and to a developmental toxicity study with continuation-ratio logits applied to an ordinal response with clustered observations.},

We propose an exact trend test for exchangeably correlated binary data when groups of correlated observations are ordered. This exact approach is based on an exponential model derived by Molenberghs and Ryan (1999) and Ryan and Molenberghs (1999) and provides natural analogues to Fisher's exact test and the binomial trend test when the data are correlated.

Specifically, we propose an extension of the multivariate logistic model to handle nonignorable nonresponse. This method yields estimates of the mean parameters under a variety of assumptions regarding the distribution of the unobserved responses. Because these models make unverifiable identifying assumptions, we recommended conducting sensitivity analyses that provide a range of inferences, each of which is valid under different assumptions for nonresponse.

For example, in evaluating a new anti-epileptic medication both the total number of seizures a patient has during the study period as well as the severity (e.g., mild, severe) of each seizure could be measured. In order to arrive at a full picture of drug or treatment performance, one needs to jointly model the number of events and their correlated ordinal severity measures. A separate analysis is not recommended as it is inefficient and can lead to what we define as ``zero length bias'' in estimates of treatment effect on severity. This paper proposes a general, likelihood based, marginal regression model for jointly modeling the number of events and their correlated ordinal severity measures. We describe parameter estimation issues and derive the Fisher information matrix for the joint model in order to obtain the asymptotic covariance matrix of the parameter estimates. A limited simulation study is conducted to examine the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimators. Using this joint model, we propose tests that incorporate information from both the number of events and their correlated ordinal severity measures. The methodology is illustrated with two examples from clinical trials: the first concerning a new drug treatment for epilepsy; the second evaluating the effect of a cholesterol lowering medication on coronary artery disease.},

We present a latent autoregressive model for longitudinal binary data subject to informative missingness. In this model, a Gaussian autoregressive process is shared between the binary response and missing-data processes, thereby inducing informative missingness. Our approach extends the work of others who have developed models that link the various processes through a shared random effect but do not allow for autocorrelation. We discuss parameter estimation using Monte Carlo EM and demonstrate through simulations that incorporating within-subject autocorrelation through a latent autoregressive process can be very important when longitudinal binary data is subject to informative missingness.

To take advantage of this new technology in Grid computing, we introduced the concept of virtual workspaces which can be configured, managed and deployed in a Grid environment. Since clusters underlie most significant Grid deployments today, in this paper we extended the notion of virtual workspaces to include virtual clusters.

Count data models can be speci\textasciimacron{}ed with additive or multiplicative errors. It is shown that, in general, a set of instruments is not orthogonal to both error types. Simultaneous equations with a dependent count variable often do not have a reduced form which is a simple function of the instruments. However, a simultaneous model with a count and a binary variable can only be logically consistent when the system is recursive. The GMM estimator is used in the estimation of a model explaining the number of visits to doctors, with as a possible endogenous regressor a self-reported binary health index. Further, a model is estimated, in stages, that includes latent health instead of the binary health index.},

Meanwhile, there exists a wide range of different methods to analyze such data, with autoregressive and cross-lagged models being 2 of the most well known representatives. Unfortunately, in these models time is only considered implicitly, making it difficult to account for unequally spaced measurement occasions or to compare parameter estimates across studies that are based on different time intervals. Stochastic differential equations offer a solution to this problem by relating the discrete time model to its underlying model in continuous time. It is the goal of the present article to introduce this approach to a broader psychological audience. A step-by-step review of the relationship between discrete and continuous time modeling is provided, and we demonstrate how continuous time parameters can be obtained via structural equation modeling. An empirical example on the relationship between authoritarianism and anomia is used to illustrate the approach.},

First we introduce the idea of a `working parameter' to facilitate the search for ef\textregistered{}cient data augmentation schemes and thus fast EM implementations. Second, summarizing various recent extensions of the EM algorithm, we formulate a general alternating expectation{$\pm$} conditional maximization algorithm AECM that couples \textasciimacron{}exible data augmentation schemes with model reduction schemes to achieve ef\textregistered{}cient computations. We illustrate these methods using multivariate t-models with known or unknown degrees of freedom and Poisson models for image reconstruction. We show, through both empirical and theoretical evidence, the potential for a dramatic reduction in computational time with little increase in human effort. We also discuss the intrinsic connection between EM-type algorithms and the Gibbs sampler, and the possibility of using the techniques presented here to speed up the latter. The main conclusion of the paper is that, with the help of statistical considerations, it is possible to construct algorithms that are simple, stable and fast.},

  abstract = {As research expands in multiagent intelligent systems, investigators need new tools for evaluating the artificial societies they study. It is impossible, for example, to correlate heterogeneity with performance in multiagent robotics without a quantitative metric of diversity. Currently diversity is evaluated on a bipolar scale with systems classified as either heterogeneous or homogeneous, depending on whether any of the agents differ. Unfortunately, this labeling doesn't tell us much about the extent of diversity in heterogeneous teams. How can it be determined if one system is more or less diverse than another? Heterogeneity must be evaluated on a continuous scale to enable substantive comparisons between systems. To enable these types of comparisons, we introduce: (1) a continuous measure of robot behavioral difference, and (2) hierarchic social entropy, an application of Shannon's information entropy metric to robotic groups that provides a continuous, quantitative measure of robot team diversity. The metric captures important components of the meaning of diversity, including the number and size of behavioral groups in a society and the extent to which agents differ. The utility of the metrics is demonstrated in the experimental evaluation of multirobot soccer and multirobot foraging teams.},

Basic theory of splines in mixed model analyses is reviewed, and estimates from analyses of weights of Australian Angus cattle from birth to 820 days of age are presented. Data comprised 84 533 records on 20 731 animals in 43 herds, with a high proportion of animals with 4 or more weights recorded. Changes in weights with age were modelled through B-splines of age at recording. A total of thirteen analyses, considering different combinations of linear, quadratic and cubic B-splines and up to six knots, were carried out. Results showed good agreement for all ages with many records, but fluctuated where data were sparse. On the whole, analyses using B-splines appeared more robust against ``end-of-range'' problems and yielded more consistent and accurate estimates of the first eigenfunctions than previous, polynomial analyses. A model fitting quadratic B-splines, with knots at 0, 200, 400, 600 and 821 days and a total of 91 covariance components, appeared to be a good compromise between detailedness of the model, number of parameters to be estimated, plausibility of results, and fit, measured as residual mean square error.},

  abstract = {Emotion research has long been dominated by the ``standard method'' of displaying posed or acted static images of facial expressions of emotion. While this method has been useful, it is unable to investigate the dynamic nature of emotion expression. Although continuous self-report traces have enabled the measurement of dynamic expressions of emotion, a consensus has not been reached on the correct statistical techniques that permit inferences to be made with such measures. We propose generalized additive models and generalized additive mixed models as techniques that can account for the dynamic nature of such continuous measures. These models allow us to hold constant shared components of responses that are due to perceived emotion across time, while enabling inference concerning linear differences between groups. The generalized additive mixed model approach is preferred, as it can account for autocorrelation in time series data and allows emotion decoding participants to be modeled as random effects. To increase confidence in linear differences, we assess the methods that address interactions between categorical variables and dynamic changes over time. In addition, we provide comments on the use of generalized additive models to assess the effect size of shared perceived emotion and discuss sample sizes. Finally, we address additional uses, the inference of feature detection, continuous variable interactions, and measurement of ambiguity.},

In this setting we compare three approaches that have been proposed for estimation of the correlation in the framework of generalized estimating equations (GEE): quasi-least squares (QLS), pseudo-likelihood (PL), and an approach we refer to as Wang\textendash{}Carey (WC). We prove that WC and QLS are identical for the first-order autoregressive AR(1) correlation structure. Using simulations, we then develop guidelines for selection of an appropriate method for analysis of data from a longitudinal trial. In particular, we argue that no method is uniformly superior for analysis of unbalanced and unequally spaced data with a Markov correlation structure. Choice of the best approach will depend on the degree of imbalance and variability in the temporal spacing of measurements, value of the correlation, and type of outcome, e.g. binary or continuous. Finally, we contrast the methods in analysis of a longitudinal study of obesity following renal transplantation in children.},

By complex, I mean a model that contains terms related by marginality or hierarchy, such as polynomial terms, or main effects and interactions. I call these tables or graphs effect displays. Effect displays are constructed by identifying high-order terms in a generalised linear model. Fitted values under the model are computed for each such term. The lower-order `relatives' of a high-order term (e.g., main effects marginal to an interaction) are absorbed into the term, allowing the predictors appearing in the high-order term to range over their values. The values of other predictors are fixed at typical values: for example, a covariate could be fixed at its mean or median, a factor at its proportional distribution in the data, or to equal proportions in its several levels. Variations of effect displays are also described, including representation of terms higher-order to any appearing in the model.},

The purpose of this paper is to compare the EM and MCMC approaches in three cases of different complexity; the examples include model order selection, continuous-time HMMs and variants of HMMs in which the observed data depends on many hidden variables in an overlapping fashion. All these examples in some way or another originate from real-data applications. Neither EM nor MCMC analysis of HMMs is a black-box methodology without need for user-interaction, and we will illustrate some of the problems, like poor mixing and long computation times, one may expect to encounter.},

  abstract = {Loglinear unidimensional and multidimensional Rasch models are considered for the analysis of repeated observations of polytomous indicators with ordered response categories. Reparameterizations and parameter restrictions are provided which facilitate specification of a variety of hypotheses about latent processes of change. Models of purely quantitative change in latent traits are proposed as well as models including structural change. A conditional likelihood ratio test is presented for the comparison of unidimensional and multiple scales Rasch models. In the context of longitudinal research, this renders possible the statistical test of homogeneity of change against subject-specific change in latent traits. Applications to two empirical data sets illustrate the use of the models.},

  abstract = {Item factor analysis has a rich tradition in both the structural equation modeling and item response theory frameworks. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a novel combination of various Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation routines to estimate parameters of a wide variety of confirmatory item factor analysis models. Further, I show that these methods can be implemented in a flexible way which requires minimal technical sophistication on the part of the end user. After providing an overview of item factor analysis and MCMC, results from several examples (simulated and real) will be discussed. The bulk of these examples focus on models that are problematic for current ``gold-standard'' estimators. The results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain accurate parameter estimates using MCMC in a relatively user-friendly package.},

  abstract = {Traditional Rasch estimation of the item and student parameters via marginal maximum likelihood, joint maximum likelihood or conditional maximum likelihood, assume individuals in clustered settings are uncorrelated and items within a test that share a grouping structure are also uncorrelated. These assumptions are often violated, particularly in educational testing situations, in which students are grouped into classrooms and many test items share a common grouping structure, such as a content strand or a reading passage. Consequently, one possible approach is to explicitly recognize the clustered nature of the data and directly incorporate random effects to account for the various dependencies. This article demonstrates how the multilevel Rasch model can be estimated using the functions in R for mixed-effects models with crossed or partially crossed random effects. We demonstrate how to model the following hierarchical data structures: a) individuals clustered in similar settings (e.g., classrooms, schools), b) items nested within a particular group (such as a content strand or a reading passage), and c) how to estimate a teacher \texttimes{} content strand interaction.},

The modeling framework subsumes standard multidimensional IRT models, bifactor IRT models, and testlet response theory models as special cases. Features of the model lead to a reduction in the dimensionality of the latent variable space, and consequently significant computational savings. An EM algorithm for full-information maximum marginal likelihood estimation is developed. Simulations and real data demonstrations confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. Three real data sets from a large-scale educational assessment, a longitudinal public health survey, and a scale development study measuring patient reported quality of life outcomes are analyzed as illustrations of the model's broad range of applicability.},

We discuss some contemporary forms of structural equation models (SEMs) based on the inclusion of latent variables. The specific goals of this review are to clarify basic SEM definitions, consider relations to classical models, focus on testable features of the new models, and provide recent references to more complete presentations. A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We first outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider definitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful.},

  abstract = {GEEs (generalized estimating equations) provide a framework for flexibly modeling clustered data. Generalized linear model (GLM) components are used to specify marginal mean and variance functions, and ``working'' covariance models specify multivariate structure. The indefiniteness of the estimation and inference framework is a basis for criticism from theoretical quarters (Crowder, Bka 1995), but also a basis for interesting interface design challenges and opportunities. I will comprehensively describe the redesign of S4/R-targeted GEE solvers. Basic issues include a) choice of language, b) representation of complex clustered data structures to accommodate, e.g., responses and predictors obtained on discordant timing sequences; c) inheritance from and interoperation with existing tools for multivariate modeling; d) choice of class/method decomposition to support recognition of statistical data types; d) weak implementation methods to ease retargeting to DSC platforms as they mature. Peripheral issues include a) exploitation of XMLbased literate programming methods; b) automatic generation of javadoc-like hypertext doc for S4/R classes and methods.},

  abstract = {From a theoretical perspective, the paper considers the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator of the correlation coefficient, principally regarding precision, in various types of bivariate model which are popular in the applied literature. The models are: `Full\textendash{}Full', in which both variables are fully observed; `Censored\textendash{}Censored', in which both of the variables are censored at zero; and finally, `Binary\textendash{}Binary', in which both variables are observed only in sign. For analytical convenience, the underlying bivariate distribution which is assumed in each of these cases is the bivariate logistic. A central issue is the extent to which censoring reduces the level of Fisher's information pertaining to the correlation coefficient, and therefore reduces the precision with which this important parameter can be estimated.},

  abstract = {A vast literature has recently been concerned with the analysis of variation in disease counts recorded across geographical areas with the aim of detecting clusters of regions with homogeneous behavior. Most of the proposed modeling approaches have been discussed for the univariate case and only very recently spatial models have been extended to predict more than one outcome simultaneously. In this paper we extend the standard finite mixture models to the analysis of multiple, spatially correlated, counts. Dependence among outcomes is modeled using a set of correlated random effects and estimation is carried out by numerical integration through an EM algorithm without assuming any specific parametric distribution for the random effects. The spatial structure is captured by the use of a Gibbs representation for the prior probabilities of component membership through a Strauss-like model. The proposed model is illustrated using real data.},

  title = {A {{General Maximum Likelihood Analysis}} of {{Variance Components}} in {{Generalized Linear Models}}},
  volume = {55},
  abstract = {This paper describes an EM algorithm for nonparametric maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in generalized linear models with variance component structure. The algorithm provides an alternative analysis to approximate MQL and PQL analyses (McGilchrist and Aisbett, 1991, Biometrical Journal 33, 131-141; Breslow and Clayton, 1993; Journal of the American Statistical Association 88, 9-25; McGilchrist, 1994, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 56, 61-69; Goldstein, 1995, Mtultilevel Statistical Models) and to GEE analyses (Liang and Zeger, 1986, Biometrika 73, 13-22). The algorithm, first given by Hinde and Wood (1987, in Longitudinal Data Analysis, 110-126), is a generalization of that for random effect models for overdispersion in generalized linear models, described in Aitkin (1996, Statistics and Computing 6, 251-262). The algorithm is initially derived as a form of Gaussian quadrature assuming a normal mixing distribution, but with only slight variation it can be used for a completely unknown mixing distribution, giving a straightforward method for the fully nonparametric ML estimation of this distribution. This is of value because the ML estimates of the GLM parameters can be sensitive to the specification of a parametric form for the mixing distribution. The nonparametric analysis can be extended straightforwardly to general random parameter models, with full NPML estimation of the joint distribution of the random parameters. This can produce substantial computational saving compared with full numerical integration over a specified parametric distribution for the random parameters. A simple method is described for obtaining correct standard errors for parameter estimates when using the EM algorithm. Several examples are discussed involving simple variance component and longitudinal models, and small-area estimation.},

  abstract = {Some conditional models to deal with binary longitudinal responses are proposed, extending random eects models to include serial dependence of Markovian form, and hence allowing for quite general association structures between repeated observations recorded on the same individual. The presence of both these components implies a form of dependence between them, and so a complicated expression for the resulting likelihood. To handle this problem, we introduce, as a \textregistered{}rst instance, what Follmann and Wu (1995) called, in a dierent setting, an approximate conditional model, which represents an optimal choice for the general framework of categorical longitudinal responses. Then we de\textregistered{}ne two more formally correct models for the binary case, with no assumption about the distribution of the random eect. All of the discussed models are estimated by means of an EM algorithm for nonparametric maximum likelihood. The algorithm, an adaptation of that used by Aitkin (1996) for the analysis of overdispersed generalized linear models, is initially derived as a form of Gaussian quadrature, and then extended to a completely unknown mixing distribution. A large scale simulation work is described to explore the behaviour of the proposed approaches in a number of dierent situations.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal studies collect information on a sample of individuals which is followed over time to analyze the effects of individual and time-dependent characteristics on the observed response. These studies often suffer from attrition: individuals drop out of the study before its completion time and thus present incomplete data records. When the missing mechanism, once conditioned on other (observed) variables, does not depend on current (eventually unobserved) values of the response variable, the dropout mechanism is known to be ignorable. We propose a selection model extending semiparametric variance component models for longitudinal binary responses to allow for dependence between the missing data mechanism and the primary response process.

  abstract = {Researchers typically analyze time-series-cross-section data with a binary dependent variable (BTSCS) using ordinary logit or probit. However, BTSCS observations are likely to violate the independence assumption of the ordinary logit or probit statistical model. It is well known that if the observations are temporally related that the results of an ordinary logit or probit analysis may be misleading. In this paper, we provide simple diagnostic for temporal depdence and a simple remedy. Our remedy is based on the idea that BTSCS data are identical to grouped duration data. This remedy does not require the BTSCS analyst to acquire any further methodological skills, and it can be easily implemented in any standard statistical software package. While our approach is suitable for any type of BTSCS data, we provide examples and applications from the field of International Relations, where BTSCS data are frequently used. We use our methodology to reassess Oneal and Russett's (1997) findings regarding the relationship between economic interdependence, democracy, and peace. Our analyses show that (1) their finding that economic interdependence is associated with peace is an artifact of their failure to account for temporal dependence yet (2) their finding that democracy inhibits conflict is upheld even taking duration dependence into account.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop analytic techniques that can be used to produce appropriate inferences from a data set in which imputation for missing values has been carried out using predictive means. Our derivations are based on asymptotic expansions of point estimators and their associated variance estimators, and the resulting formulas can be thought of as first-order approximations to the estimators that would be used with multiple imputation. The procedures developed can be used either for univariate missing data or for multivariate missing data in which the variables are either missing or observed together, and they are designed for situations in which the complete-data estimator is a smooth function of linear statistics. We illustrate properties of our methods in several examples, including abstract problems as well as applications to large data sets from studies carried out by the federal government.},

This article presents new expressions for the derivatives of loglikelihood functions for these models with respect to unknown components of variance. These expressions are easy to evaluate and involve the same quantities needed for EM algorithms for maximum-likelihood  ML  and restricted maximum-likelihood  RML  estimation. Three applications for these derivative expressions are developed:  a  new hybrid algorithms for ML and RML estimation that combine the stability and low per-iteration cost of EM with the rapid convergence of Fisher scoring;  b  a new analytic method for correcting traditional empirical Bayes interval estimates for the uncertainty associated with variance components; and  c  a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian posterior simulation that has the low per-iteration cost of a conventional Gibbs sampler but converges rapidly.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) are the two most common approaches to missing data analysis. In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information ({$\gamma$}) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which {$\gamma$} and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on {$\gamma$}, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.},

Results suggest that mean substitution is a poor method for handling missing data, whereas both multiple imputation and full information maximum likelihood are recommended alternatives to this approach.

For example, one might be interested in the extent to which the effect of diet on blood pressure is mediated through sodium intake and the extent to which it operates through other pathways. In the context of such mediation analysis, even if the effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded, estimates of direct and indirect effects will be biased if control is not made for confounders of the mediator-outcome relationship. Often data are not collected on such mediator-outcome confounding variables; the results in this paper allow researchers to assess the sensitivity of their estimates of direct and indirect effects to the biases from such confounding. Specifically, the paper provides formulas for the bias in estimates of direct and indirect effects due to confounding of the exposure-mediator relationship and of the mediator-outcome relationship. Under some simplifying assumptions, the formulas are particularly easy to use in sensitivity analysis. The bias formulas are illustrated by examples in the literature concerning direct and indirect effects in which mediator-outcome confounding may be present.},

However, one important criticism is that experiments merely provide a black-box view of causality and fail to identify causal mechanisms. Specifically, critics argue that although experiments can identify average causal effects, they cannot explain the process through which such effects come about. If true, this represents a serious limitation of experimentation, especially for social and medical science research that strive to identify causal mechanisms. In this paper, we consider several different experimental designs that help identify average natural indirect effects. Some of these designs require the perfect manipulation of an intermediate variable, while others can be used even when only imperfect manipulation is possible. We use recent social science experiments to illustrate the key ideas that underlie each of the proposed designs.},

  abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

Such an analysis allows researchers to explore various causal pathways, going beyond the estimation of simple causal effects. Recently, Imai et al. (2008) [3] and Imai et al. (2009) [2] developed general algorithms to estimate causal mediation effects with the variety of data types that are often encountered in practice. The new algorithms can estimate causal mediation effects for linear and nonlinear relationships, with parametric and nonparametric models, with continuous and discrete mediators, and with various types of outcome variables. In this paper, we show how to implement these algorithms in the statistical computing language R. Our easy-to-use software, mediation, takes advantage of the object-oriented programming nature of the R language and allows researchers to estimate causal mediation effects in a straightforward manner. Finally, mediation also implements sensitivity analyses which can be used to formally assess the robustness of findings to the potential violations of the key identifying assumption. After describing the basic structure of the software, we illustrate its use with several empirical examples.},

  abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

The methods are applied to data from a study of nursing interventions for postoperative pain. We address the cases of more than two treatment groups, and an interaction among mediators.

A simulation study is discussed that examines the actual Type I error rate and power of Q2 in comparison to the LSMR omnibus F test under normality and non-normality. Results suggest that Q2 has favorable sampling properties as long as the sample size-to-predictors ratio is not too small, and Q2 can be a good alternative to the omnibus F test when the response variable is non-normal.},

The effect of specific international classification of functioning variables on a subjective measure of physical health is investigated, which requires strategies for variable selection. In this context, we propose methods for the selection of ordinally scaled independent variables in the classical linear model. The ordinal structure is taken into account by use of a difference penalty on adjacent dummy coefficients. It is shown how the group lasso can be used for the selection of ordinal predictors, and an alternative blockwise boosting procedure is proposed. Both methods are discussed in general, and applied to international classification of functioning core sets for chronic widespread pain.},

Also a Bayesian motivation is provided. The concept is generalized to the case of non-normal outcomes within the framework of generalized linear models by applying penalized likelihood estimation. Simulation studies and real world data serve for illustration and to compare the approaches to methods often seen in practice, namely simple linear regression on the group labels and pure dummy coding.

The amount of data produced by these analyses has reached the limits of many common bioinformatics computing infrastructures. High Performance Computing (HPC) systems offer a solution to this issue. The Simple Parallel R INTerface (SPRINT) is a package that provides biostatisticians with easy access to HPC systems and allows the addition of parallelized functions to R. This paper will present how we added a parallelized permutation testing function in R using SPRINT and how this function performs on a supercomputer for executions of up to 512 processes.},

However, the usual package-building mechanism assumes that native routines are written in C or Fortran 77; code written in Fortran 95 is not supported. This document shows how to create an R package for Windows when the package contains routines in Fortran 95. I show how build and distribute the package in binary form, so that users of R for Windows can download it as a .zip file and install it just as they would any package from CRAN. This procedure is not officially sanctioned by the R Development Core Team, because the resulting R package is neither platformindependent (it works only on Windows) nor open-source (the actual Fortran code need not be included). Nevertheless, this procedure may be very useful for researchers who wish to include native Fortran 95 in an R package or who, for whatever reason, do not wish to distribute their Fortran source.},

In this workshop, we will try to ease the learning curve of using R for your data analysis. Experience with statistical software is NOT required! We will use data simulation as well as real data sets, to explore topics like t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression. We will also show how R produces publication-quality figures. If time permits, we will also explore how to extend R with your own routines for analyzing and/or plotting data. You are encouraged to bring your own data set, if accompanied by a ``codebook'' file specifying variables (columns), data codes, etc. (Both files must be in plain ASCII).},

  abstract = {This paper considers the role of covariates when using predicted probabilities to interpret main effects and interactions in logit models. While predicted probabilities are very intuitive for interpreting main effects and interactions, the pattern of results depends on the contribution of covariates. We introduce a concept called the covariate contribution, which reflects the aggregate contribution of all of the remaining predictors (covariates) in the model and a family of tools to help visualize the relationship between predictors and the predicted probabilities across a variety of covariate contributions. We believe this strategy and the accompanying tools can help researchers who wish to use predicted probabilities as an interpretive framework for logit models acquire and present a more comprehensive interpretation of their results. These visualization tools could be extended to other models (such as binary probit, multinomial logistic, ordinal logistic models, and other nonlinear models).},

Theoretically we show that, with proper choices of the smoothing and regularization parameters, the proposed procedure can be as efficient as the oracle estimator (Fan and Li, 2001). We also study the asymptotic properties of the estimator when the number of parametric effects diverges with the sample size. Frequentist and Bayesian estimates of the covariance and confidence intervals are derived for the estimators. One great advantage of this procedure is its linear mixed model (LMM) representation, which greatly facilitates its implementation by using standard statistical software. Furthermore, the LMM framework enables one to treat the smoothing parameter as a variance component and hence conveniently estimate it together with other regression coefficients. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed procedure.},

Compared to existing estimation equation based approaches, our procedure provides valid inference for data with missing at random, and will be more efficient if the specified model is correct. Another advantage of the new procedure is its easy computation for both regression components and variance parameters. We show that the double penalized problem can be conveniently reformulated into a linear mixed model framework, so that existing software can be directly used to implement our method. For the purpose of model inference, we derive both frequentist and Bayesian variance estimation for estimated parametric and nonparametric components. Simulation is used to evaluate and compare the performance of our method to the existing ones. We then apply the new method to a real data set from a lactation study.},

The group lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sample size but with sparse true underlying structure. We further use a two-stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the group lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, owing to the two-stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical. The methods are used on simulated and real data sets about splice site detection in DNA sequences.},

Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines.

  title = {Variable {{Selection}} in {{Measurement Error Models}}},
  abstract = {Measurement error data or errors-in-variable data are often collected in many studies. Natural criterion functions are often unavailable for general functional measurement error models due to the lack of information on the distribution of the unobservable covariates. Typically, the parameter estimation is via solving estimating equations. In addition, the construction of such estimating equations routinely requires solving integral equations, hence the computation is often much more intensive compared with ordinary regression models. Because of these difficulties, traditional best subset variable selection procedures are not applicable, and in the measurement error model context, variable selection remains an unsolved issue. In this paper, we develop a framework for variable selection in measurement error models via penalized estimating equations. We first propose a class of selection procedures for general parametric measurement error models and for general semiparametric measurement error models, and study the asymptotic properties of the proposed procedures. Then, under certain regularity conditions and with a properly chosen regularization parameter, we demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs as well as an oracle procedure. We assess the finite sample performance via Monte Carlo simulation studies and illustrate the proposed methodology through the empirical analysis of a familiar data set.},

The sampling properties for the two procedures are investigated. The rate of convergence and the asymptotic normality of the resulting estimates are established. We further demonstrate that, with proper choices of the penalty functions and the regularization parameter, the resulting estimates perform asymptotically as well as an oracle procedure (Fan and Li 2001). Choice of smoothing parameters is also discussed. Finite sample performance of the proposed variable selection procedures is assessed by Monte Carlo simulation studies.

Toward this goal, we develop a class of information criteria for missing-data problems, called ICH,Q, which yields the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion as special cases. The computation of ICH,Q requires an analytic approximation to a complicated function, called the H-function, along with output from the EM algorithm used in obtaining maximum likelihood estimates. The approximation to the H-function leads to a large class of information criteria, called ICH(\~ k),Q. Theoretical properties of ICH(\~ k),Q, including consistency, are investigated in detail. To eliminate the analytic approximation to the H-function, a computationally simpler approximation to ICH,Q, called ICQ, is proposed, the computation of which depends solely on the Q-function of the EM algorithm. Advantages and disadvantages of ICH\~(k),Q and ICQ are discussed and examined in detail in the context of missing-data problems. Extensive simulations are given to demonstrate the methodology and examine the small-sample and large-sample performance of ICH(\~ k),Q and ICQ in missing-data problems.

  abstract = {Colony collapse disorder (CCD), a syndrome whose de{\TH}ning trait is the rapid loss of adult worker honey bees, Apis mellifera L., is thought to be responsible for a minority of the large overwintering losses experienced by U.S. beekeepers since the winter 2006 {\DH}2007. Using the same data set developed to perform a monofactorial analysis (PloS ONE 4: e6481, 2009), we conducted a classi{\TH}cation and regression tree (CART) analysis in an attempt to better understand the relative importance and interrelations among different risk variables in explaining CCD. Fifty-{\TH}ve exploratory variables were used to construct two CART models: one model with and one model without a cost of misclassifying a CCD-diagnosed colony as a non-CCD colony. The resulting model tree that permitted for misclassi{\TH}cation had a sensitivity and speci{\TH}city of 85 and 74\%, respectively. Although factors measuring colony stress (e.g., adult bee physiological measures, such as {\ss}uctuating asymmetry or mass of head) were important discriminating values, six of the 19 variables having the greatest discriminatory value were pesticide levels in different hive matrices. Notably, coumaphos levels in brood (a miticide commonly used by beekeepers) had the highest discriminatory value and were highest in control (healthy) colonies. Our CART analysis provides evidence that CCD is probably the result of several factors acting in concert, making af{\ss}icted colonies more susceptible to disease. This analysis highlights several areas that warrant further attention, including the effect of sublethal pesticide exposure on pathogen prevalence and the role of variability in bee tolerance to pesticides on colony survivorship.},

The distribution of the maximally selected chi-square statistic has already been derived when the best cutpoint is chosen from a continuous or an ordinal X, but not when the best split is chosen from a nominal X. In this paper, we derive the exact distribution of the maximally selected chi-square statistic in this case using a combinatorial approach. Applications of the derived distribution to variable selection and hypothesis testing are discussed based on simulations. As an illustration, our method is applied to a birth data set.},

  abstract = {The association between a binary variable Y and a variable X having an at least ordinal measurement scale might be examined by selecting a cutpoint in the range of X and then performing an association test for the obtained 2 {\^A} 2 contingency table using the chi-square statistic. The distribution of the maximally selected chi-square statistic (i.e. the maximal chi-square statistic over all possible cutpoints) under the null-hypothesis of no association between X and Y is different from the known chi-square distribution. In the last decades, this topic has been extensively studied for continuous X variables, but not for non-continuous variables of at least ordinal measurement scale (which include e.g. classical ordinal or discretized continuous variables). In this paper, we suggest an exact method to determine the finite-sample distribution of maximally selected chi-square statistics in this context. This novel approach can be seen as a method to measure the association between a binary variable and variables having an at least ordinal scale of different types (ordinal, discretized continuous, etc). As an illustration, this method is applied to a new data set describing pregnancy and birth for 811 babies.},

  title = {Bias in {{Random Forest Variable Importance Measures}}: {{Illustrations}}, {{Sources}} and a {{Solution}}},
  abstract = {Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale level or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale level or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analysing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research.},

Hence, suitable heteroskedasticity consistent (HC) and heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimators have been receiving attention in the econometric literature over the last 20 years. To apply these estimators in practice, an implementation is needed that preferably translates the conceptual properties of the underlying theoretical frameworks into computational tools. In this paper, such an implementation in the package sandwich in the R system for statistical computing is described and it is shown how the suggested functions provide reusable components that build on readily existing functionality and how they can be integrated easily into new inferential procedures or applications. The toolbox contained in sandwich is extremely flexible and comprehensive, including specific functions for the most important HC and HAC estimators from the econometric literature. Several real-world data sets are used to illustrate how the functionality can be integrated into applications.},

Applied researchers have often ignored the problem, probably because major statistical packages do not estimate robust standard errors in FE models. Not surprisingly, this can lead to severe bias in the standard error estimates, both in hypothetical and real-life situations. The paper gives a systematic overview of the differnt standard error estimators and the assumptions under which they are consistent (in the usual large N , small T asymptotics). One of the possible reasons why the robust estimators are not used often is a fear of their bad finite sample properties. The most important results of the paper, based on an extensive Monte Carlo study, show that those fears are in general unwarranted. I also present evidence that it is the abolute size of the cross-sectional sample that primarily affects the finite-sample behavior, not the relaitve size compared to the time-series dimension. That indicates good small-sample behavior even when N {$\approx$} T . I introduce a simple direct test analogous to that of White (1980) for the restrictive assumptions behind the estimators. Its finite sample properties are fine except for low power in very small samples.},

An intuitively appealing graphical representation of complex ML-SEMs is introduced that succinctly describes the underlying model and its assumptions. The use of definition variables (i.e., observed variables used to fix model parameters to individual specific data values) is extended to the case of ML-SEMs for clustered data with random slopes. Empirical examples of multilevel CFA and ML-SEM with random slopes are provided along with scripts for fitting such models in SAS Proc Mixed, Mplus, and Mx. Methodological issues regarding estimation of complex ML-SEMs and the evaluation of model fit are discussed. Further potential applications of ML-SEMs are explored.},

  abstract = {In the Political Analysis ``Special Issue on Multilevel Modeling of Large Clusters'' (Autumn 2005) several papers discuss the adoption of two step models to analyze data from multiple surveys. Complementing that issue, in this paper we perform Monte Carlo experiments comparing the two syep logit model's performance to maximum likelihood, bayesian and pooled estimation using clustered standard errors. We find that at low levels of residual variation across groups, pooling the data is the most efficient method, but even clustered standard errors provide incorrect coverage. We show that jackknife estimation can overcome this limitation. When the level of residual variation is higher the random effects estimators (two-step, ML or Bayesian) outperform pooled estimation both in efficiency and quality of the inferences. We also find that pooled estimation is less robust to violations of the random effects assumptions. The two step approach is somewhat less efficient than alternate approaches but has important advantages: it is computationally simpler and easier to extend to new models. We conclude by replicating two studies with data from multiple surveys, which illustrate the importance of allowing coefficients to vary across groups and the flexibility of the two step approach.},

  abstract = {The development of statistically efficient and computationally practicable estimation methods for the analysis of structural equation models with multiple nonlinear effects has been called for by substantive researchers in psychology, marketing research, and sociology. But the development of efficient methods is complicated by the fact that a nonlinear model structure implies specifically nonnormal multivariate distributions for the indicator variables. In this paper, nonlinear structural equation models with quadratic forms are introduced and a new QuasiMaximum Likelihood method for simultaneous estimation of model parameters is developed with the focus on statistical efficiency and computational practicability. The Quasi-ML method is based on an approximation of the nonnormal density function of the joint indicator vector by a product of a normal and a conditionally normal density. The results of Monte-Carlo studies for the new Quasi-ML method indicate that the parameter estimation is almost as efficient as ML estimation, whereas ML estimation is only computationally practical for elementary models. Also, the Quasi-ML method outperforms other currently available methods with respect to efficiency. It is demonstrated in a Monte-Carlo study that the Quasi-ML method permits computationally feasible and very efficient analysis of models with multiple latent nonlinear effects. Finally, the applicability of the Quasi-ML method is illustrated by an empirical example of an aging study in psychology.},

  abstract = {Structural Equation Modeling with latent variables (SEM) is a powerful tool for social and behavioral scientists, combining many of the strengths of psychometrics and econometrics into a single framework. The most common estimator for SEM is the full-information maximum likelihood estimator (ML), but there is continuing interest in limited information estimators because of their distributional robustness and their greater resistance to structural specification errors. However, the literature discussing model fit for limited information estimators for latent variable models is sparse compared to that for full information estimators. We address this shortcoming by providing several specification tests based on the 2SLS estimator for latent variable structural equation models developed by Bollen (1996). We explain how these tests can be used to not only identify a misspecified model, but to help diagnose the source of misspecification within a model. We present and discuss results from a Monte Carlo experiment designed to evaluate the finite sample properties of these tests. Our findings suggest that the 2SLS tests successfully identify most misspecified models, even those with modest misspecification, and that they provide researchers with information that can help diagnose the source of misspecification.},

Unfortunately, the network structures, processes and the impact of these informal horizontal inter-organisational relations between nation-states are mostly unknown.The main objective of this article is to measure and explain the selective pattern of informal bilateral relations of high officials of the EU Member States' ministerial bureaucracies on the occasion of an EU Intergovernmental Conference.

The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process `driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes (`actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes (`dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior.},

In contrast, in this paper we focus on the temporal nature of such data. In particular, we look at the problems of temporal link prediction and node ranking, and describe new methods that illustrate opportunities for data mining and machine learning techniques in this context. Experimental results are discussed for a large set of co-authorship events measured over multiple years, and a large corporate email data set spanning 21 months.},

  issn = {0954-2892, 1471-6909},
  abstract = {Does perceived disagreement in political discussion help or hinder citizens' political participation? Some argue that disagreement prompts reflection, perspective-taking, and tolerance. Challengers argue that disagreement fosters ambivalence and hinders participatory activities and turnout. One seminal study that tackled this dilemma formulated the `cross-pressures' hypothesis (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, \& Gaudet, /), which posited that the more individuals are betwixt and between conflicting social positions, the longer the time for their vote intention to crystallize (and the lower the likelihood they would vote). This paper offers a critique and refinement of the cross-pressures hypothesis. First, previous studies confounded intra-individual and structural sources of cross-pressures. Second, past operationalizations of exposure to disagreement focused on the sheer amount of opposition to the individual's point of view, rather than his or her exposure to two conflicting points of view. A new measure\textemdash{}network ambivalence\textemdash{}is proposed to capture the latter dynamic. Conceptual and methodological refinements of the cross-pressures hypothesis are tested on a representative sample of voting-age respondents in the United States, interviewed on the American National Election Study  panel (N = ,). Results suggest that not only were these pressures hardly detrimental to participation, but they also facilitated the formation of considered electoral preferences.},

It is attempted to disentangle influence and selection processes in reciprocal and non-reciprocal friendships. An actorbased model is described for the co-evolution of friendship networks and smoking behavior. This model considers alternative selection and influence mechanisms, and models continuous-time changes in network and behavior. The data consists of a longitudinal sample of 1326 Finnish adolescents in 11 high schools. Findings suggest that selection as well as influence processes play an important role in adolescent smoking behavior. Selection had a relatively stronger role than influence, in particular when selecting non-reciprocal friends. The strength of both influence and selection processes decreased over time.},

  abstract = {Previous research demonstrated that information contained in triad censuses from heterogeneous collections of social networks occupies a high dimensional space. Regions of this space, and locations of triad censuses within it, are largely defined by lower order network properties: network density and dyad distributions [Faust, K., 2006. Comparing social networks: size, density, and local structure. Metodolos\textasciicaron{}ki Zvezki (Advances in Methodology and Statistics) 3 (2), 185\textendash{}216; Faust, K., 2007. Very local structure in social networks. Sociological Methodology 37, 209\textendash{}256]. The current paper extends comparative work on triad censuses by addressing three related issues. First, it determines and interprets the space occupied by triad censuses for 128 friendship networks gathered using a limited choice sociometric protocol. Second, it constructs a theoretical space for triad censuses expected given lower order graph properties and examines the dimensionality and shape of this space. Third, it brings together these lines of investigation to determine where the empirical triad censuses reside within the theoretical space. Results show that the empirical triad censuses are almost perfectly represented in one dimension (explaining 99\% of the data) and that network density explains over 96\% of the variance in locations on this dimension. In contrast, the theoretical space for triad censuses is at least four-dimensional, with distinctive regions defined by network density and dyad distributions. Within this theoretical space, the empirical triad censuses occupy a restricted region that closely tracks triad censuses expected given network density. Results differ markedly from prior findings that the space occupied by triad censuses from heterogeneous social networks is of high dimensionality. Results also reinforce observations about constraints that network size and density place on graph level indices.},

  abstract = {Species spatial distributions are the result of population demography, behavioral traits, and species interactions in spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions. Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site-by-species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis. Doing so allows one to deal with spatially explicit ecological models of beta diversity in a biogeographic context through the multiscale analysis of spatial patterns in original species data tables, including spatial characterization of fitted or residual variation from environmental models. We summarize here the recent progress for specifying spatial features through spatial weighting matrices and spatial eigenfunctions in order to define spatially constrained or scale-explicit multivariate analyses. Through a worked example on tropical tree communities, we also show the potential of the overall approach to identify significant residual spatial patterns that could arise from the omission of important unmeasured explanatory variables or processes.},

  abstract = {"This monograph contributes to the area of comparative statistical inference. Attention is restricted to the important subfield of statistical estimation. The book is intended for an audience having a solid grounding in probability and statistics at the level of the year-long undergraduate course taken by statistics and mathematics majors. The necessary background on decision theory and the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to estimation is presented and carefully discussed in Chapters 1-3. The "threshold problem"--identifying the boundary between Bayes estimators which tend to outperform standard frequentist estimators and Bayes estimators which don't--is formulated in an analytically tractable way in Chapter 4. The formulation includes a specific (decision-theory based) criterion for comparing estimators. The centerpiece of the monograph is Chapter 5, in which, under quite general conditions, an explicit solution to the threshold is obtained for the problem of estimating a scalar parameter under squared error loss. The six chapters that follow address a variety of other contexts in which the threshold problem can be productively treated. Included are treatments of the Bayesian consensus problem, the threshold problem for estimation problems involving of multidimensional parameters and/or asymmetric loss, the estimation of nonidentifiable parameters, empirical Bayes methods for combining data from 'similar' experiments, and linear Bayes methods for combining data from 'related' experiments. The final chapter provides an overview of the monograph's highlights and a discussion of areas and problems in need of further research."--BOOK JACKET},

Some of the examples represent data that is not perfectly "behaved" so as to provide a more realistic view of situations readers will likely encounter with their own data. Detailed explanations of input statements help readers generalize what they learn to their own analyses.

  abstract = {In many applications of multilevel modeling, group-level (L2) variables for assessing grouplevel effects are generated by aggregating variables from a lower level (L1). However, the observed group mean might not be a reliable measure of the unobserved true group mean. In this article, we propose a Bayesian approach for estimating a multilevel latent contextual model that corrects for measurement error and sampling error (i.e., sampling only a small number of L1 units from a L2 unit) when estimating group-level effects of aggregated L1 variables. Two simulation studies were conducted to compare the Bayesian approach with the maximum likelihood approach implemented in Mplus. The Bayesian approach showed fewer estimation problems (e.g., inadmissible solutions) and more accurate estimates of the grouplevel effect than the maximum likelihood approach under problematic conditions (i.e., small number of groups, predictor variable with a small intraclass correlation). An application from educational psychology is used to illustrate the different estimation approaches.},

  title = {Prior {{Sensitivity Analysis}} in {{Default Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling}}},
  abstract = {Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) has recently gained popularity because it enables researchers to fit complex models while solving some of the issues often encountered in classical estimation, such as nonconvergence and inadmissible solutions. An important component of any Bayesian analysis is the prior distribution of the unknown model parameters. Often, researchers rely on default priors, which are constructed in an automatic fashion without requiring substantive prior information. However, the prior can have a serious influence on the estimation of the model parameters, which may harm the accuracy of the estimates. In this paper, we investigate the performance of three different default priors: noninformative improper priors, vague proper priors, and empirical Bayes priors, with the latter being novel in the BSEM literature. Based on an extensive simulation study, we find that these three default BSEM methods perform very differently, especially with small samples. A careful prior sensitivity analysis is therefore needed when performing a default BSEM analysis. For this purpose, we provide a practical step-by-step guide for practitioners to conducting a prior sensitivity analysis in default BSEM. Our recommendations are illustrated using a well-known case study from the (B)SEM literature and all code for conducting the prior sensitivity analysis is made available in the online appendix.},

  title = {Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling},
  abstract = {In conventional structural equation models, all latent variables and indicators vary between units (typically subjects) and are assumed to be independent across units. The latter assumption is violated in multilevel settings where units are nested in clusters, leading to within-cluster dependence. Different approaches to extending structural equation models for such multilevel settings are examined. The most common approach is to formulate separate within-cluster and between-cluster models. An advantage of this set-up is that it allows software for conventional structural equation models to be `tricked' into estimating the model. However, the standard implementation of this approach does not permit cross-level paths from latent or observed variables at a higher level to latent or observed variables at a lower level, and does not allow for indicators varying at higher levels. A multilevel regression (or path) model formulation is therefore suggested in which some of the response variables and some of the explanatory variables at the different levels are latent and measured by multiple indicators. The Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Modeling (GLLAMM) framework allows such models to be specified by simply letting the usual model for the structural part of a structural equation model include latent and observed variables varying at different levels.},

  abstract = {A unifying framework for generalized multilevel structural equation modeling is introduced. The models in the framework, called generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM), combine features of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and structural equation models (SEM) and consist of a response model and a structural model for the latent variables. The response model generalizes GLMMs to incorporate factor structures in addition to random intercepts and coefficients. As in GLMMs, the data can have an arbitrary number of levels and can be highly unbalanced with different numbers of lower-level units in the higher-level units and missing data. A wide range of response processes can be modeled including ordered and unordered categorical responses, counts, and responses of mixed types. The structural model is similar to the structural part of a SEM except that it may include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. For example, unit-level latent variables (factors or random coefficients) can be regressed on cluster-level latent variables. Special cases of this framework are explored and data from the British Social Attitudes Survey are used for illustration. Maximum likelihood estimation and empirical Bayes latent score prediction within the GLLAMM framework can be performed using adaptive quadrature in gllamm, a freely available program running in Stata.},

  abstract = {Social scientists are increasingly interested in multilevel hypotheses, data, and statistical models as well as moderation or interactions among predictors. The result is a focus on hypotheses and tests of multilevel moderation within and across levels of analysis. Unfortunately, existing approaches to multilevel moderation have a variety of shortcomings, including conflated effects across levels of analysis and bias due to using observed cluster averages instead of latent variables (i.e., ``random intercepts'') to represent higher-level constructs. To overcome these problems and elucidate the nature of multilevel moderation effects, we introduce a multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) logic that clarifies the nature of the problems with existing practices and remedies them with latent variable interactions. This remedy uses random coefficients and/or latent moderated structural equations (LMS) for unbiased tests of multilevel moderation. We describe our approach and provide an example using the publicly available High School and Beyond data with Mplus syntax in Appendix. Our MSEM method eliminates problems of conflated multilevel effects and reduces bias in parameter estimates while offering a coherent framework for conceptualizing and testing multilevel moderation effects.},

Bayesian methods do not rely on asympotics, a property that can be a hindrance when employing frequentist methods in small sample contexts. Although Bayesian methods are better equipped to model data with small sample sizes, estimates are highly sensitive to the specification of the prior distribution. If this aspect is not heeded, Bayesian estimates can actually be worse than frequentist methods, especially if frequentist small sample corrections are utilized. We show with illustrative simulations and applied examples that relying on software defaults or diffuse priors with small samples can yield more biased estimates than frequentist methods. We discuss conditions that need to be met if researchers want to responsibly harness the advantages that Bayesian methods offer for small sample problems as well as leading small sample frequentist methods.},

In this article, we discuss in nontechnical terms the role of sample size in MLM and SEM and present findings from the latest simulation work on the performance of each approach at sample sizes typical of prevention research. For each statistical approach, we draw from extant simulation studies to establish lower bounds for sample size (e.g., MLM can be applied with as few as ten groups comprising ten members with normally distributed data, restricted maximum likelihood estimation, and a focus on fixed effects; sample sizes as small as N=50 can produce reliable SEM results with normally distributed data and at least three reliable indicators per factor) and suggest strategies for making the best use of the modeling approach when N is near the lower bound.},

  abstract = {In multilevel modeling (MLM), group-level (L2) characteristics are often measured by aggregating individual-level (L1) characteristics within each group so as to assess contextual effects (e.g., group-average effects of socioeconomic status, achievement, climate). Most previous applications have used a multilevel manifest covariate (MMC) approach, in which the observed (manifest) group mean is assumed to be perfectly reliable. This article demonstrates mathematically and with simulation results that this MMC approach can result in substantially biased estimates of contextual effects and can substantially underestimate the associated standard errors, depending on the number of L1 individuals per group, the number of groups, the intraclass correlation, the sampling ratio (the percentage of cases within each group sampled), and the nature of the data. To address this pervasive problem, the authors introduce a new multilevel latent covariate (MLC) approach that corrects for unreliability at L2 and results in unbiased estimates of L2 constructs under appropriate conditions. However, under some circumstances when the sampling ratio approaches 100\%, the MMC approach provides more accurate estimates. Based on 3 simulations and 2 real-data applications, the authors evaluate the MMC and MLC approaches and suggest when researchers should most appropriately use one, the other, or a combination of both approaches.},

The use of potentially inaccurate prior information may, however, have detrimental effects, especially in small samples. The present Monte Carlo simulation study compares the statistical performance of classical estimation techniques with Bayesian estimation using different prior specifications for a two-level SEM with either continuous or ordinal indicators. Using two software programs (Mplus and Stan), differential effects of between- and within-level sample sizes on estimation accuracy were investigated. Moreover, it was tested to which extent inaccurate priors may have detrimental effects on parameter estimates in categorical indicator models. For continuous indicators, Bayesian estimation did not show performance advantages over ML. For categorical indicators, Bayesian estimation outperformed WLSMV solely in case of strongly informative accurate priors. Weakly informative inaccurate priors did not deteriorate performance of the Bayesian approach, while strong informative inaccurate priors led to severely biased estimates even with large sample sizes. With diffuse priors, Stan yielded better results than Mplus in terms of parameter estimates.},

After reviewing the conceptual and computational features of these methods, a new implementation of hurdle and zero-inflated regression models in the functions hurdle() and zeroinfl() from the package pscl is introduced. It re-uses design and functionality of the basic R functions just as the underlying conceptual tools extend the classical models. Both hurdle and zeroinflated model, are able to incorporate over-dispersion and excess zeros\textemdash{}two problems that typically occur in count data sets in economics and the social sciences\textemdash{}better than their classical counterparts. Using cross-section data on the demand for medical care, it is illustrated how the classical as well as the zero-augmented models can be fitted, inspected and tested in practice.},

  abstract = {"Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, Second Edition, is divided into two basic parts, the first presenting R packages, functions, classes and methods for handling spatial data. This part is of interest to users who need to access and visualise spatial data. Data import and export for many file formats for spatial data are covered in detail, as is the interface between R and the open source GRASS GIS and the handling of spatio-temporal data. The second part showcases more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis, including spatial point pattern analysis, interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis and disease mapping. The coverage of methods of spatial data analysis ranges from standard techniques to new developments, and the examples used are largely taken from the spatial statistics literature. All the examples can be run using R contributed packages available from the CRAN website, with code and additional data sets from the book's own website. Compared to the first edition, the second edition covers the more systematic approach towards handling spatial data in R, as well as a number of important and widely used CRAN packages that have appeared since the first edition. This book will be of interest to researchers who intend to use R to handle, visualise, and analyse spatial data. It will also be of interest to spatial data analysts who do not use R, but who are interested in practical aspects of implementing software for spatial data analysis. It is a suitable companion book for introductory spatial statistics courses and for applied methods courses in a wide range of subjects using spatial data, including human and physical geography, geographical information science and geoinformatics, the environmental sciences, ecology, public health and disease control, economics, public administration and political science."--},

  abstract = {"The Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series (SUMS) is designed for undergraduates in the mathematical sciences. From core foundational material to final year topics, SUMS books take a fresh and modern approach and are ideal for self-study or for a one-or two-semester course. Each book includes numerous examples, problems and fully-worked solutions. N. H. Bingham. John M. Fry Regression" "Regression is the branch of Statistics in which a dependent variable of interest is modelled as a linear combination of one or more predictor variables, together with a random error. The subject is inherently two-or higher-dimensional, thus an understanding of Statistics in one dimension is essential." "Regression: Linear Models in Statistics fills the gap between introductory statistical theory and more specialist sources of information. In doing so, it provides the reader with a number of worked examples, and exercises with full solutions." "The book begins with simple linear regression (one predictor variable), and analysis of variance (ANOVA), and then further explores the area through inclusion of topics such as multiple linear regression (several predictor variables) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The book concludes with special topics such as non-parametric regression and mixed models, time series, spatial processes and design of experiments." "Aimed at 2nd and 3rd year undergraduates studying Statistics, Regression: Linear Models in Statistics requires a basic knowledge of (one-dimensional) Statistics, as well as Probability and Standard Linear Algebra. Possible companions include John Haigh's Probability Models, and T. S. Blyth \& E. F. Robertsons' Basic Linear Algebra and Further Linear Algebra."--BOOK JACKET},

  abstract = {"The majority of data sets collected by researchers in all disciplines are multivariate, meaning that several measurements, observations, or recordings are taken on each of the units in the data set. These units might be human subjects, archaeological artifacts, countries, or a vast variety of other things. In a few cases, it may be sensible to isolate each variable and study it separately, but in most instances all the variables need to be examined simultaneously in order to fully grasp the structure and key features of the data. For this purpose, one or another method of multivariate analysis might be helpful, and it is with such methods that this book is largely concerned. Multivariate analysis includes methods both for describing and exploring such data and for making formal inferences about them. The aim of all the techniques is, in general sense, to display or extract the signal in the data in the presence of noise and to find out what the data show us in the midst of their apparent chaos. An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R explores the correct application of these methods so as to extract as much information as possible from the data at hand, particularly as some type of graphical representation, via the R software. Throughout the book, the authors give many examples of R code used to apply the multivariate techniques to multivariate data."--Publisher's description},

  abstract = {"This monograph contributes to the area of comparative statistical inference. Attention is restricted to the important subfield of statistical estimation. The book is intended for an audience having a solid grounding in probability and statistics at the level of the year-long undergraduate course taken by statistics and mathematics majors. The necessary background on decision theory and the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to estimation is presented and carefully discussed in Chapters 1-3. The "threshold problem"--identifying the boundary between Bayes estimators which tend to outperform standard frequentist estimators and Bayes estimators which don't--is formulated in an analytically tractable way in Chapter 4. The formulation includes a specific (decision-theory based) criterion for comparing estimators. The centerpiece of the monograph is Chapter 5, in which, under quite general conditions, an explicit solution to the threshold is obtained for the problem of estimating a scalar parameter under squared error loss. The six chapters that follow address a variety of other contexts in which the threshold problem can be productively treated. Included are treatments of the Bayesian consensus problem, the threshold problem for estimation problems involving of multidimensional parameters and/or asymmetric loss, the estimation of nonidentifiable parameters, empirical Bayes methods for combining data from 'similar' experiments, and linear Bayes methods for combining data from 'related' experiments. The final chapter provides an overview of the monograph's highlights and a discussion of areas and problems in need of further research."--BOOK JACKET},

But patterns of violent crime and other health conditions are often affected by similar characteristics of the built environment. In this paper, methods and perspectives from spatial epidemiology are used in an analysis of violent crimes in San Antonio, TX. Bayesian statistical methods are used to examine the contextual influence of several aspects of the built environment. Additionally, spatial regression models using Bayesian model specifications are used to examine spatial patterns of violent crime risk. Results indicate that the determinants of violent crime depend on the model specification, but are primarily related to the built environment and neighborhood socioeconomic conditions. Results are discussed within the context of a rapidly growing urban area with a diverse population.},

Such spatial instruments have proved attractive: they are convenient to obtain, typically have power, and are plausibly exogenous. We argue that the assumptions underlying spatial instruments remain poorly understood and challenge whether spatial instruments can satisfy the conditions required for valid instruments. First, when cross-unit dependence exists in the endogenous predictor, other cross-unit relationships\textemdash{}spillovers and interdependence\textemdash{}likely exist as well and risk violations of the exclusion restriction. Second, spatial instruments produce simultaneity in the first-stage equation, as le -hand side outcomes are included as right-hand side predictors. Because the instrument and the endogenous variable are simultaneously determined, the exclusion restriction is, necessarily and by construction, violated. Taken together, these concerns lead us to conclude that spatial instruments are rarely, if ever, valid.},

The focus is on data that are ``missing not at random'' (MNAR), in which case both multiple imputation and listwise deletion are known to be biased. In these simulations, multiple imputation yields results that are frequently more biased, less e icient, and with worse coverage than listwise deletion when data are MNAR. This is the case even with very strong correlations between fully observed variables and variables with missing values, such that the data are very nearly ``missing at random.''

Good multidisciplinary research has kept pace, but challenges remain. What are the missions of urban arts and culture? How can offerings and engagement become more equitable and diverse? In fashioning good policy and making funding and planning decisions, what do city leaders and advocates need to know about the location preferences of artists, arts organizations and arts participants? I review what we know and don't know to date on these questions, and close with reflections on the potential of arts and cultural research to link to broader urban theories, capitalize on interdisciplinary research and mixed methods, and integrate international research and experience in the field.},

It highlights seven key research questions: what kinds of coercive power do cities have at their disposal? In what ways are cities terrains of coercion? Who are the agents of coercion? Who are its subjects? What are the configurations of coercive and non-coercive power in cities? When is coercion legitimate? And, what are the implications of enduring coercion for our understandings of urban change? The paper concludes that a better appreciation of coercive cities is essential for an adequate understanding of urban power in the 21st century.},

  abstract = {Regression models are often used, explicitly or implicitly, for decision making. However, the choices
made in setting up the models (e.g., inclusion of predictors based on statistical significance) do not map directly into decision procedures. Bayesian inference works more naturally with decision analysis but presents problems in practice when noninformative prior distributions are used with sparse data. We do not attempt to provide a general solution to this problem, but rather present an application of a
decision problem in which inferences from a regression model are used to estimate costs and benefits.
Our example is a reanalysis of a recent meta-analysis of incentives for reducing survey nonresponse. We then apply the results of our fitted model to the New York City Social Indicators Survey, a biennial telephone survey with a high nonresponse rate. We consider the balance of estimated costs, cost savings,
and response rate for different choices of incentives. The explicit analysis of the decision problem reveals the importance of interactions in the fitted regression model.},

Our aims are threefold: to understand the meanings and perceptions of people engaged in lifestyle politics and collective action; to examine the motives guiding individual change; and to explore the linkage processes between lifestyle politics and collective action. Identity process theory is considered as a lens to examine the processes and the motives of identity via a thematic analysis of 22 interviews. This study combined interviews with people seeking social change through their lifestyles with interviews with members of action groups and social movements. We found that each participant's identity is guided by identity motives such as distinctiveness, continuity, and psychological coherence. Besides, lifestyle politics is evaluated as an effective way to bring about social change, depending on the individual experience of perceived power to bring about change through collective action. Overall, lifestyle politics states the way in which the participants decided to live, to construct their identities, and to represent their beliefs about the right thing to do. Lifestyle politics complements collective action as a strategy to increase the potential of bringing about social change. The implications of this research are discussed in relation to the importance of understanding the processes of identity and lifestyle change in the context of social, environmental, and political change.},

In this debate, political scientists draw on social identity theory to clarify the nature of partisanship and its political consequences in the United States and other developed and developing democracies. In particular, social identity theory has been used to develop an expressive model of partisanship, which stands in contrast to an instrumental model grounded in ideological and policy considerations. Included here are a discussion of the key motivational and cognitive components of social identity theory and an explanation of how the theory can be applied to the study of partisanship. The focus is on the measurement of partisanship, its social nature, its origins in convergent identities, and its ability to generate strong emotions and drive political engagement. Lastly, areas for future partisanship research are discussed. These areas include the study of negative partisan identities, coalitional identities in multiparty systems, and the political situations in which expressive and instrumental aspects of partisanship are most common.},

As with other social practices, these cognitive schemas and embodied experiences are not innate, but rather learned. Drawing on interviews with 46 people who regularly carry guns, as well as fieldwork at firearms training schools, we examine the process by which people learn the cognitive schemas (how people think about guns) and embodied experiences (how people physically experience guns) associated with the practice of carrying guns.},

  abstract = {The last two decades have seen a pronounced shift in the focus of American immigration law from patrolling the nation's border to policing its interior. This development has involved local law enforcement agents gaining powers previously held centrally and exclusively by the federal executive. Yet neither the payoffs to the president from this regime nor localities' incentives to participate in it are explained by the current scholarship on immigration or federalism. This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing intergovernmental policymaking in a federated system. An empirical test using the 287(g) program highlights the model's central trade-off. By deputizing local officers with the powers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, 287(g) induced a dramatic increase in immigration enforcement at almost no federal expense. But the localities that selected into the program wielded their newfound agency differently from their federal counterparts, shifting the focus of policing efforts from felonies to traffic offenses and misdemeanor drug possession. I further present evidence that these decisions were driven by electoral politics, in particular accountability to nativist constituencies.},

The parameters in these models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. In general, there is no closed-form solution for these estimates and they must be determined by iterative algorithms such as EM iterations or general nonlinear optimization. Many of the intermediate calculations for such iterations have been expressed as generalized least squares problems. We show that an alternative representation as a penalized least squares problem has many advantageous computational properties including the ability to evaluate explicitly a profiled log-likelihood or log-restricted likelihood, the gradient and Hessian of this profiled objective, and an ECME update to refine this objective.},

Unfortunately, MrP comes with stringent data demands. As a consequence, scholars cannot apply MrP in countries without detailed census data, and when such data are available, the modeling is restricted to a few variables. This article introduces multilevel regression with synthetic poststratification (MrsP), which relaxes the data requirement of MrP to marginal distributions, substantially increases the prediction precision of the method, and extends its use to countries without census data. The findings of Monte Carlo, U.S., and Swiss analyses show that, using the same predictors, MrsP usually performs in standard applications as well as the currently used standard approach, and it is superior when additional predictors are modeled. The better performance and the more straightforward implementation promise that MrsP will further stimulate subnational research.},

We describe the need for realistic depictions of `rational' and `irrational' choice, multiple theories to portray the multifaceted nature of complex contexts, and the combination of applied and basic research. To set this new agenda, we build on two foundational strategies: identifying advances in the psychology of decisionmaking and describing how policy theories depict policymaking psychology in complex contexts.},

  title = {Elective {{Enforcement}}: {{The Politics}} of {{Local Immigration Policing}}},
  abstract = {The last two decades have seen a pronounced shift in the focus of American immigration law from patrolling the nation's border to policing its interior. This development has involved local law enforcement agents gaining powers previously held centrally and exclusively by the federal executive. Yet neither the payoffs to the president from this regime nor localities' incentives to participate in it are explained by the current scholarship on immigration or federalism. This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing intergovernmental policymaking in a federated system. An empirical test using the 287(g) program highlights the model's central trade-off. By deputizing local officers with the powers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, 287(g) induced a dramatic increase in immigration enforcement at almost no federal expense. But the localities that selected into the program wielded their newfound agency differently from their federal counterparts, shifting the focus of policing efforts from felonies to traffic offenses and misdemeanor drug possession. I further present evidence that these decisions were driven by electoral politics, in particular accountability to nativist constituencies.},

These measures pose the possibility of being able to answer a host of fundamental questions about political accountability and representation. In this paper, we examine the properties of six recent measures of candidates' political orientations in di erent domains. While these measures are commonly viewed as proxies for ideology, each involves very di erent choices, incentives, and contexts. Indeed, we show that there is only a weak relationship between these measures within party. This suggests that these measures are capturing domain-specific factors rather than just candidates' ideology. Moreover, these measures do poorly at distinguishing between moderate and extreme roll call voting records within each party. As a result, they fall short when it comes to facilitating empirical analysis of theories of accountability and representation in Congress. Overall, our findings suggest that future research should leverage the conceptual and empirical variation across these measures and avoid assuming they are synonymous with candidates' ideology.},

So-called ``moderate'' districts that switch hands between parties are often internally polarized: the ideological distance between Democrats and Republicans within these districts is often greater than the distance between liberal cities and conservative rural districts. We present a theoretical model in which intra-district ideological polarization makes candidates uncertain about the ideological location of the median voter, thereby reducing their incentives to offer moderate policy positions. We then demonstrate that among districts with similar median voter ideologies, the difference in legislative behavior between Democratic and Republican state legislators is greater in more ideologically heterogeneous districts. Our findings suggest that accounting for the subtleties of political geography can help explain the coexistence of a polarized legislature and a moderate mass public.},

  volume = {83},
  issn = {0162-1459},
  abstract = {[Knowledge of the area under different crops is important to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sample surveys have been designed to estimate crop areas for large regions, such as crop-reporting districts, individual states, and the United States as a whole. Predicting crop areas for small areas such as counties has generally not been attempted, due to a lack of available data from farm surveys for these areas. The use of satellite data in association with farm-level survey observations has been the subject of considerable research in recent years. This article considers (a) data for 12 Iowa counties, obtained from the 1978 June Enumerative Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and (b) data obtained from land observatory satellites (LANDSAT) during the 1978 growing season. Emphasis is given to predicting the area under corn and soybeans in these counties. A linear regression model is specified for the relationship between the reported hectares of corn and soybeans within sample segments in the June Enumerative Survey and the corresponding satellite determination for areas under corn and soybeans. A nested-error model defines a correlation structure among reported crop hectares within the counties. Given this model, the mean hectares of the crop per segment in a county is defined as the conditional mean of reported hectares, given the satellite determinations and the realized (random) county effect. The mean hectares of the crop per segment is the sum of a fixed component, involving unknown parameters to be estimated and a random component to be predicted. Variance-component estimators in the nested-error model are defined, and the generalized least-squares estimators of the parameters of the linear model are obtained. Predictors of the mean crop hectares per segment are defined in terms of these estimators. An estimator of the variance of the error in the predictor is constructed, including terms arising from the estimation of the parameters of the model. Predictions of mean hectares of corn and soybeans per segment for the 12 Iowa counties are presented. Standard errors of the predictions are compared with those of competing predictors. The suggested predictor for the county mean crop area per segment has a standard error that is considerably less than that of the traditional survey regression predictor.]},

Democrats and Republicans both say that the other party's members are hypocritical, selfish, and closed-minded, and they are unwilling to socialize across party lines. This phenomenon of animosity between the parties is known as affective polarization. We trace its origins to the power of partisanship as a social identity, and explain the factors that intensify partisan animus. We also explore the consequences of affective polarization, highlighting how partisan affect influences attitudes and behaviors well outside the political sphere. Finally, we discuss strategies that might mitigate partisan discord and conclude with suggestions for future work.},

I reevaluate this argument by examining how criminal justice policy shapes the political orientations and participation of blacks and whites.

Using data from a 2014 national survey and information on local criminal justice outcomes, I find that racially skewed criminal justice enforcement is associated with negative political orientations and lower rates of political participation for highly educated blacks. I also find that whites respond positively to similar criminal justice outcomes when they reside in areas with large black populations.

  abstract = {In studies of public reaction to policy initiatives, researchers often assume that universal social programs have the same effect on all social aggregates and are therefore conducive to social and political participation because of their comprehensive coverage, which suggests inclusive citizenship. However, structure-based differences in accessibility can distort these social programs into privileges for some and can reinforce existing inequalities. This study illustrates how social structure determines policy feedback in terms of political and civic participation in China. Using a nationally representative sample from 2005, we find that social insurance privileges public sector employees, encouraging them to be more active in political elections than in civic elections, whereas employees in the disadvantaged private sector emphasize civic elections over political elections. We argue that structural divisions in the social insurance regime serve the political purpose of maintaining state control in transitional China.},

  abstract = {Collaboration is commonplace in contemporary public administration. In many instances, policy mandates collaboration between previously unconnected organizations for those organizations to obtain essential funding for public services, thus creating new administrative structures grounded in collaboration. There exists substantial research that focuses on the collaborative process and potential outcomes of these structures, yet their emergence and development is less understood. The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) continuum of care (CoC) model is one such collaborative structure that has been the dominant administrative service delivery system used to address homelessness in the United States since the early 1990s. A historical analysis reveals that policy feedback effects help explain the emergence and persistence of the CoC model from before its origin to its eventual codification in the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009. A policy feedback perspective of the CoC model demonstrates how the interplay of policy, politics, and administration led to a mandate to collaborate to address a large-scale social problem.},

  abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are widely used in social science to examine whether the relationship between an outcome and an independent variable changes with a moderating variable. Current empirical practice tends to overlook two important problems. First, these models assume a linear interaction e ect that changes at a constant rate with the moderator. Second, estimates of the conditional e ects of the independent variable can be misleading if there is a lack of common support of the moderator. Replicating interaction e ects from recent publications in five top political science journals, we find that these core assumptions o en fail in practice, suggesting that a large portion of findings across all political science subfields based on interaction models are fragile and model dependent. We propose a checklist of simple diagnostics to assess the validity of these assumptions and o er flexible estimation strategies that allow for nonlinear interaction e ects and safeguard against excessive extrapolation.

  abstract = {A large literature on economic voting in the United States finds that the president's party is rewarded in presidential elections for strong economic performance and punished for weak performance. In contrast, there is no clear consensus about whether the local economy matters in elections at other levels of governments. In this study, we compile the largest dataset to-date on the link between the local economy and elections in the United States. We use administrative data on county-level economic conditions from 1969-2016 to examine the effect of the local economy on elections for city, county, state, and national government. We find clear evidence that the president's party is held accountable for economic performance across nearly all levels of government. In contrast, there is much weaker evidence that the party that controls other levels of government is held accountable for the economy. We also examine whether the media moderates accountability, and find tentative evidence that counties that receive more media coverage are more likely to hold the president's party accountable in federal (but not state and local) elections. Overall, our findings show that politicians from the president's party have strong electoral incentives to grow the local economy, while politicians in the opposition party have clear incentives to stymie economic growth.},

From the perspective of theoretical models of accountability, such behavior poses a puzzle: how can observable sabotage succeed, when rational voters can update on its deployment as a strategy? In our model, a potential saboteur chooses whether to sabotage an incumbent's policy by blocking its implementation. Following this decision, a voter decides whether to retain the incumbent, who is of unknown quality, or to select a challenger. We find that the incentives for sabotage are broadly shaped by the underlying popularity of the incumbent\textemdash{}it is most attractive when an incumbent is moderately unpopular. If so, sabotage may decrease the probability the incumbent is re-elected, even though sabotage is observable to the voter. This occurs because sabotage prevents the voter from using policy outcomes to update her beliefs about the incumbent's type, which in some cases will lead to voter to choose the challenger. We illustrate our theory with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act since its passage in 2010.},

These political values are assumed to help individuals filter political information and thus both minimize outside influence and guide people through complex political environments. This perspective, though, assumes that political values are stable and consistent across contexts. This piece questions that assumption and argues that political values are socially reinforced\textemdash{}that is, that political values are not internal predispositions, but the result of social influence. I consider this idea with two empirical tests: an experimental test that recreates the transmission of political values and an observational analysis of the effect of politically homogeneous social contexts on political value endorsements. Results suggest that political values are socially reinforced. The broader implication of my findings is that the concepts scholars term ``political values'' may be reflections of individuals' social contexts rather than values governing political behavior.},

In the present analysis we use the tools of network science, a set of mathematical techniques to examine the relationships between entities in a system, to create networks from the items in the Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS), a widely used instrument to measure statistics anxiety. Separate networks were constructed and analyzed for students who were high or low in statistics anxiety. The items in the STARS were the nodes in the network, with connections placed between nodes if responses to those 2 items in the STARS were correlated. The network analysis revealed differences in the overall structure of high- and low-anxiety networks and in which nodes were most ``important'' in the 2 groups, suggesting that different interventions might be required depending on the level of statistics anxiety experienced by the student. Furthermore, our results suggest that the most effective interventions for students with very high levels of statistics anxiety would need to specifically address the (incorrect) perception that strong mathematical ability is a necessary prerequisite for excelling in statistics. Centrally located nodes in the network may help instructors appropriately target classroom interventions to help all students succeed regardless of the level of statistical anxiety experienced by students.},

Scholars have made progress on many of the empirical barriers that stymied earlier researchers.

The findings of recent research show that local politics in the modern, polarized era is much more similar to other areas of American politics than previously believed. Scholars have shown that partisanship and ideology play important roles in local politics. Due to the growing ideological divergence between Democrats and Republicans, Democratic elected officials increasingly take more liberal positions, and enact more liberal policies, than Republican ones. As a result, despite the multitude of constraints on local governments, local policies in the modern era tend to largely reflect the partisan and ideological composition of their electorates.

There are clear disparities in police exposure based on race and gender, with black men and women being more likely than their peers to be policed and with black men being policed significantly more than their female counterparts.},

  abstract = {The United States has witnessed privatization of a variety of government functions over the last three decades. Media and politicians often attribute the decision to privatize to ideological commitments to small government and fiscal pressure. These claims are particularly notable in the context of prison privatization, where states and the federal government have employed private companies to operate and manage private correctional facilities. I argue state prison privatization is not a function of simple ideological or economic considerations. Rather, prison privatization has been a (potentially unintended) consequence of the administrative and legal costs associated with litigation brought by prisoners. I assemble an original database of prison privatization in the US and demonstrate that the privatization of prisons is best predicted by the legal pressure on state corrections systems, rather than the ideological orientation of a state government.},

Using an ethnographic case study of a proposed `justice campus', a carceral expansion project in a politically progressive Midwestern city, this article illuminates the capacity of mass incarceration to structure individual and community dispositions and, in doing so, to imbue even oppositional politics. At the same time, communities may adopt, reformulate, and rearticulate the symbolic work and material manifestations of mass incarceration in order to fit specific political-cultural contexts. As such, this article argues that mass incarceration is both more forceful and more subject to diverse and context-specific formulations than has been previously argued. The corporal and discursive inscription of carcerality into individual and community bodies suggests the presence of a carceral habitus and offers one way to comprehend not only mass incarceration's pervasive presence, but also its hegemonic operations even among and through people and communities who purport to reject it.},

Secondly, there are methodological advantages to studying local politics. Finally, analyzing politics at the sub-state level can generate thoroughly different kinds of questions than a purely national-level focus and can offer different answers to questions that apply more generally.

Whether such endorsements induce voters to choose ideologically similar candidates (spatial voting), or choose based on race/ethnicity (racial voting) is unclear. We address this question by examining elections in multiethnic local settings. Using original surveys and exit polls, we create comparable measures of candidate and voter ideology, and examine how race/ethnicity and ideology affect voters' choices. We also embed experiments that manipulate ethnic group endorsements. We find that ideology influences voters' choices, but that ethnic group endorsements weaken spatial voting. The latter effect among whites is driven by racial/ethnic stereotypes. These reactions explain why some candidates seek such endorsements and why others might prefer to avoid them.},

Using a new longitudinal data set spanning all states before and after they granted collective bargaining rights to teachers, the article shows that although states that mandate districts to bargain with teachers have higher education expenditures than states that do not, the differences precede collective bargaining. Difference-in-differences analyses find no evidence that introducing collective bargaining rights led to average increases in the level of resources devoted to education. Although existing theories cannot explain these null findings, the article shows one reason behind them is that most laws granting collective bargaining rights to teachers were not unambiguously prolabor, but included both pro- and anti-union provisions.},

This procedure recognizes the analyst's uncertainty over the nature of the regressors but not the dependent variable. When the analyst is uncertain whether yt is a stationary or unit root process, the test statistics proposed by PSS are uninformative for inference on the existence of a long run relationship (LRR) between yt and xt . We propose the long run multiplier (LRM) test statistic as a means of testing for LRRs without knowing whether the series are stationary or unit roots. Using stochastic simulations, we demonstrate the behavior of the test statistic given uncertainty about the univariate dynamics of both yt and xt , illustrate the bounds of the test statistic, and generate small sample and approximate asymptotic critical values for the upper and lower bounds for a range of sample sizes and model specifications. We demonstrate the utility of the bounds framework for testing for LRRs in models of public policy mood and presidential success.},

We argue that the elimination of widespread racial segregation in Southern hospitals during this period played a causal role in this improvement. Our analysis indicates that Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which mandated desegregation in institutions receiving federal funds, enabled 5,000 to 7,000 additional black infants to survive infancy from 1965-1975 and at least 25,000 infants from 1965-2002. We estimate that by themselves these infant mortality benefits generated a welfare gain of more than \$7 billion (2005\$) for 1965-1975 and more than \$27 billion for 1965-2002. These findings indicate that the benefits of the 1960s Civil Rights legislation extended beyond the labor marker and were substantially larger than recognized previously.},

  abstract = {Research Summary Based on a 2013 survey of 1,001 likely voters in Texas, public support for correctional reform in a ``red state'' was examined. Four major conclusions were revealed. First, the respondents displayed strong support for rehabilitation. Second, at least for nonviolent and/or drug offenders, the sample members showed a clear preference for the use of alternatives to incarceration as opposed to imprisonment. Third, when asked about a specific policy reform that used treatment rather than prison for nonviolent drug offenders, more than eight in ten Texans approved of the measure, and strong majorities endorsed various rationales for it. Fourth, with some minor variation, the respondents revealed substantial consensus across demographic groups in their embrace of rehabilitation and correctional reform. Policy Implications With the growth of mass imprisonment arguably at its end, the existence of strong public support for correctional reform even in the major red state of Texas, suggests that a new ``sensibility'' about crime control has taken hold. There is now an emergent national consensus that the overuse of incarceration is unsustainable and that low-risk offenders no longer should be sanctioned with a prison sentence. The American public, in Texas and beyond, is willing to support a policy agenda that includes offender treatment, prison downsizing, and alternatives to incarceration. The challenge for elected officials is to take advantage of this ideological space and to pursue this agenda. Notably, politicians in Texas and in other red states are using this opportunity to implement correctional policy reforms. The data in this study indicate that they will face no public backlash and, if anything, will gain political capital for their efforts.},

Research from the past decade both reinforces and challenges this assessment. The public clearly accepts, if not prefers, a range of punitive policies (e. g., capital punishment, three-strikes-and-you're-out laws, imprisonment). But support for get-tough policies is "mushy." Thus citizens may be willing to substitute a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for the death penalty. Especially when nonviolent offenders are involved, there is substantial support for intermediate sanctions and for restorative justice. Despite three decades of criticism, rehabilitation-particularly for the young-remains an integral part of Americans' correctional philosophy. There is also widespread support for early intervention programs. In the end, the public shows a tendency to be punitive and progressive, wishing the correctional system to achieve the diverse missions of doing justice, protecting public safety, and reforming the wayward.},

Stereotypes of African-Americans should influence attitudes on crime policy primarily when criminals are black, crimes are violent, policies are punitive, and no individuating information seriously undercuts the stereotype. Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) procedures are used to administer a series of survey experiments where the race and other characteristics of the target (e.g., criminal suspects, furlough programs, etc.) are manipulated in interviews with Lexington, Kentucky residents in a 1994 probability survey. Consistent with our expectations, we find a strong relationship between whites' images of African-American and judgments of crime and punishment, but only for black criminals who commit violent crimes, and only for punitive (vs. preventive) policies. Because these are the circumstances which typically surround the crime issue, we conclude that much of public opinion in this domain is influenced by racial concerns.},

Yet, the lack of a reliable and valid measure of this concept limits our understanding of this aspect of the criminal justice system. This research develops a measure of public support for punitive policies from 1951 to 2006 using 242 administrations of 24 unique survey indicators. It argues that punitive sentiment is politically constructed via frames focusing on the permissiveness of the criminal justice system. Punitive sentiment is estimated with an error-correction model showing both the short- and long-term relationships between punitive sentiment and presidential framing of crime, public dissatisfaction with social welfare policies, and perceptions of racial integration. The results highlight the complex dynamics responsible for the change over time in punitive sentiment as well as the possibilities of obtaining public support for alternative solutions to crime.},

Despite this, evidence suggests that rehabilitative efforts are still supported by the general public. The current study uses a national random sample to examine the impact of fear on public preference for allocating resources to rehabilitative versus punitive criminal justice system policies. Contrary to prior studies, respondents are forced to make a choice between punitive and rehabilitative options, and both the emotional and cognitive aspects of crime salience\textemdash{}fear of crime and victimization risk\textemdash{}are evaluated to determine their independent and combined impact on crime policy preference. The findings suggest that the majority of the public prefers putting resources toward rehabilitative crime polices, but fear of crime and risk of victimization both reduce this tendency.

These databases allow survey methodologists to leverage political variables, such as party registration and past voting behavior, at a large scale and free of over-reporting bias or endogeneity between survey responses. We develop a general process to take advantage of this data, illustrated through an example where we use multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to produce vote choice estimates for the 2012 presidential election, projecting those estimates to 195 million registered voters in a post-election context. Our inferences are stable and reasonable down to demographic subgroups within small geographies, even down to the county or Congressional District level. They can be used to supplement exit polls, which have become increasingly problematic and are not available in all geographies. We discuss problems, limitations, and open areas of research.},

To date, our understanding of this partisan heterogeneity has been limited to analysis of national- or, less commonly, state-level opinion poll subsamples. However, the dynamics of political representation and issue commitments play out over more finely resolved state and local scales. Here we use previously validated multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) models (Howe et al., Nat Clim Chang 5(6):596\textendash{}603 2015; Mildenberger et al., PLoS One 11(8):e0159774 2016) combined with a novel approach to measuring the distribution of party members to model, for the first time, the spatial distribution of partisan climate and energy opinions. We find substantial geographic variation in Republican climate opinions across states and congressional districts. While Democratic party members consistently think human-caused global warming is happening and support climate policy reforms, the intensity of their climate beliefs also varies spatially at state and local scales. These results have policy-relevant implications for the trajectory of US climate policy reforms.},

We then use the level of emotional arousal, as measured by vocal pitch, in each of the Justices' voices during these arguments to accurately predict many of their eventual votes on these cases.

  abstract = {[In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.]},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

With a unique survey panel to explore changing support for Republican presidential candidates over the primary season, we test these competing theories and examine their fit to the pattern of support and opposition to Trump before and after the primaries. We find that populist attitudes and anti-Muslim bias were considerably more important than authoritarian dispositions, and immigration and trade policy attitudes in explaining support for Trump among Republicans during the 2016 primary season. We demonstrate how Trump's supporters became more diverse as they increased in numbers over the primary season, but new supporters were not a representative sample of Republicans who initially supported other candidates.},

We assemble an original dataset of 10,708 elections in approximately 298 medium and large counties over the past 25 years. Based on a regression discontinuity design, we find that electing a Democratic legislator rather than a Republican one leads the average county to increase spending by about 5\%.

  abstract = {What factors influence agenda setting behavior in state legislatures in the United States? Using the localized effects of climate change, we examine whether notable changes in temperature can raise the salience of the issue, thus encouraging a legislative response. To evaluate the behavior of individual legislators around climate policy, we utilize an original data set that includes geographic mapping of climate anomalies at the state legislative district level and incorporates individual, chamber, district, and state characteristics to predict climate bill sponsorship. Using a multilevel model that estimates climate change bill sponsorship among 25,000 legislators from 2011 to 2015, we find a robust relationship between temperature anomalies and bill sponsorship for Democratic members of state legislators while Republicans are unresponsive to such factors. Our data and methodological approach allow us to examine legislative action on climate change beyond final policy passage and offers an opportunity to understand the motivations behind climate innovation in the American states.},

  abstract = {Labor unions have long been important political actors, mobilizing voters, shaping their members' attitudes, and influencing representation and economic inequality. However, little is known regarding unions' influence on political knowledge. In this paper, I argue that unions increase their members' political knowledge through two mechanisms: direct information provision and workplace discussion of politics. I use data from recent national election surveys and a matching technique, showing that union members, particularly those with less formal education, who face higher costs in seeking out political information, are significantly more politically knowledgeable than their non-union counterparts and better informed about where political parties and candidates stand on the issues. I conclude by discussing unions' capacity to reduce knowledge gaps and foster a more politically informed electorate.},

In this paper, I first introduce a theoretical focus on impression management on dating apps. Next, I explain the choice of autoethnography as a method. Drawing from various source materials like personal journaling and chats with matches, I present two autoethnographic pieces: one focusing on my self-presentation as a dating app researcher, and the other on my own dating app use. I follow these by analyzing my motivations and impression construction in the dating app environment, keeping in mind theoretical insights. I conclude with a discussion into the challenges of an autoethnographic approach to impression management.},

  abstract = {Anonymous student evaluations of teaching (SETs) are used by colleges and universities to measure teaching effectiveness and to make decisions about faculty hiring, firing, re-appointment, promotion, tenure, and merit pay. Although numerous studies have found that SETs correlate with various teaching effectiveness irrelevant factors (TEIFs) such as subject, class size, and grading standards, it has been argued that such correlations are small and do not undermine the validity of SETs as measures of professors' teaching effectiveness. However, previous research has generally used inappropriate parametric statistics and effect sizes to examine and to evaluate the significance of TEIFs on personnel decisions. Accordingly, we examined the influence of quantitative vs. non-quantitative courses on SET ratings and SET based personnel decisions using 14,872 publicly posted class evaluations where each evaluation represents a summary of SET ratings provided by individual students responding in each class. In total, 325,538 individual student evaluations from a US mid-size university contributed to theses class evaluations. The results demonstrate that class subject (math vs. English) is strongly associated with SET ratings, has a substantial impact on professors being labeled satisfactory vs. unsatisfactory and excellent vs. non-excellent, and the impact varies substantially depending on the criteria used to classify professors as satisfactory vs. unsatisfactory. Professors teaching quantitative courses are far more likely not to receive tenure, promotion, and/or merit pay when their performance is evaluated against common standards.},

We surveyed 447 alt-right adherents on a battery of psychological measures, comparing their responses to those of 382 non-adherents. Alt-right adherents were much more distrustful of the mainstream media and government; expressed higher Dark Triad traits, social dominance orientation, and authoritarianism; reported high levels of aggression; and exhibited extreme levels of overt intergroup bias, including blatant dehumanization of racial minorities. Cluster analyses suggest that alt-right supporters may separate into two subgroups: one more populist and anti-establishment and the other more supremacist and motivated by maintaining social hierarchy.

We assemble a dataset on roughly 3.9 million free citizens in the Confederacy, and show that slaveowners were more likely to fight than non-slaveowners. We then exploit a randomized land lottery held in 1832 in Georgia. Households of lottery winners owned more slaves in 1850 and were more likely to have sons who fought in the Confederate Army. We conclude that slaveownership, in contrast to some other kinds of wealth, compelled southerners to fight despite free-rider incentives because it raised their stakes in the war's outcome.},

  abstract = {The difficulties arising from using statistical significance to demonstrate the truth and utility of a hypothesis have been known for some time (Cohen 1994). To develop a more rigorous conception of substantive significance, a new means of determining substantive significance is presented, and a new technique for its implementation is demonstrated. The predictive approach, as differentiated from the explanatory approach (in which significance testing is grounded), concentrates on best determining the value of observations that a given model has not yet seen (Shmueli 2010). The technique for implementation, the best subset in validation algorithm (or BeSIVa), attempts to make the best prediction possible using all available observations. Dividing observations into two separate datasets, training data used for modeling and test data which determines the quality of models at making predictions, BeSiVa tries to best predict predict a dependent variable using a randomly selected test set. BeSiVa is applied to an old question, the choice to vote, as well as two new ones: innumeracy on the proportion of minorities in the United States (Alba, Rumbaut, and Marotz 2005) and support for Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential run. When 656 variables from the GSS were provided to determine if the algorithm regularly selected theoretically relevant independent variables to model turnout, BeSiVa selected a theoretically relevant predictor, voting in the last presidential election, each time. Then, a smaller selection of variables that had been theoretically verified as related to turnout in the 2000 presidential election were then provided. From these variables, BeSiVa clearly favored sociological and psychological theories of turnout over the more recent mobilization theory. Having demonstrated how BeSiVa selected relevant independent variables when analyzing turnout, it was applied to newer questions. Innumeracy's theoretical origins were extended, showing how religious identification and financial satisfaction predicted an individual's ability to estimate minority proportions. BeSiVa also suggested origins for President Trump's support, grounding it in racial resentment, feelings on President Obama, and concerns about security and immigration. The algorithm's tendency to make theoretically grounded models, even when irrelevant independent variables were provided demonstrates its capability at making useful predictive models with relevant predictors.},

To explain the use of interaction terms in nonlinear models.

Study Design
We discuss the motivation for including interaction terms in multivariate analyses. We then explain how the straightforward interpretation of interaction terms in linear models changes in nonlinear models, using graphs and equations. We extend the basic results from logit and probit to difference-in-differences models, models with higher powers of explanatory variables, other nonlinear models (including log transformation and ordered models), and panel data models.

Empirical Application
We show how to calculate and interpret interaction effects using a publicly available Stata data set with a binary outcome. Stata 11 has added several features which make those calculations easier. LIMDEP code also is provided.

Conclusions
It is important to understand why interaction terms are included in nonlinear models in order to be clear about their substantive interpretation.},

And the likelihood of beliefs about one variable (e.g., the performance of a favored politician) depends on beliefs about other, related variables (e.g., the quality and bias of newspapers reporting on the politician). I propose a formal approach to combine these two forces, creating a tractable way to study the distortion of related beliefs. The approach unifies several central ideas from psychology (e.g., motivated reasoning, attribution) that have been applied heavily to political science. Concrete applications shed light on why successful individuals sometimes attribute their performance to luck (``imposter syndrome''), why those from advantaged groups believe they in fact face high levels of discrimination (the ``persecution complex''), and why partisans disagree about the accuracy and bias of news sources.},

We confront this shortcoming by examining lower court adherence to the precedents of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom. As the Law Lords in the United Kingdom primarily oversee a single lower court, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, this design provides a unique opportunity to assess the factors that influence hierarchical responses to precedent. We offer a framework in which legal, rather than strategic, factors influence the propensity with which lower court judges rely on the precedents of the House of Lords. Using an original data set of over 13,000 lower court responses to the precedents of the House of Lords between 1970 and 2002, our findings challenge the efficacy of principal\textendash{}agent accounts and shed new light on how horizontal stare decisis influences decision-making behavior within the United Kingdom.},

Six major reform movements (diversion, decarceration, due process, decriminalization, deterrence, and just deserts) are reviewed to illustrate how or-ganizational dynamics function to resist, distort, and frustrate the reform's original purposes. The authors also argue that potential reformers cannot ignore the sur-rounding social, political, economic, and ideological context. Reformers must recog-nize that legal, programmatic, and administrative reforms are themselves circum-scribed by political and economic forces. Future efforts at change must include detailed analyses of the larger political-economic structure and its interconnections},

  abstract = {This paper presents new causal estimates of incarceration's effect on voting, using administrative data on criminal sentencing and voter turnout. I use the random case assignment process of a major county court system as a source of exogenous variation in the sentencing of misdemeanor cases. Focusing on misdemeanor defendants allows for generalization to a large population, as such cases are very common. Among first-time misdemeanor defendants, I find evidence that receiving a short jail sentence decreases voting in the next election by several percentage points. Results differ starkly by race. White defendants show no demobilization, while Black defendants show substantial turnout decreases due to jail time. Evidence from pre-arrest voter histories suggest that this difference could be due to racial differences in exposure to arrest. These results paint a picture of large-scale, racially-disparate voter demobilization in the wake of incarceration.},

  abstract = {A revelatory account of the misdemeanor machine that unjustly brands millions of Americans as criminalsPunishment Without Crime offers an urgent new interpretation of inequality and injustice in America by examining the paradigmatic American offense: the lowly misdemeanor. Based on extensive original research, legal scholar Alexandra Natapoff reveals the inner workings of a massive petty offense system that produces over 13 million cases each year. People arrested for minor crimes are swept through courts where defendants often lack lawyers, judges process cases in mere minutes, and nearly everyone pleads guilty. This misdemeanor machine starts punishing people long before they are convicted; it punishes the innocent; and it punishes conduct that never should have been a crime. As a result, vast numbers of Americans -- most of them poor and people of color -- are stigmatized as criminals, impoverished through fines and fees, and stripped of drivers' licenses, jobs, and housing.For too long, misdemeanors have been ignored. But they are crucial to understanding our punitive criminal system and our widening economic and racial divides.A Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2018},

  abstract = {American public opinion tends to be sticky. Although the news cycle might temporarily affect the public's mood on contentious issues like abortion, the death penalty, or gun control, public opinion toward these issues has remained remarkably constant over decades. There are notable exceptions, however, particularly with regard to divisive issues that highlight identity politics. For example, over the past three decades, public support for same-sex marriage has risen from scarcely more than a tenth to a majority of the population. Why have people's minds changed so dramatically on this issue, and why so quickly? It wasn't just that older, more conservative people were dying and being replaced in the population by younger, more progressive people; people were changing their minds. Was this due to the influence of elite leaders like President Obama? Or advocacy campaigns by organizations pushing for greater recognition of the equal rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) people? Listen, We Need to Talk tests a new theory, what Brian Harrison and Melissa Michelson call The Theory of Dissonant Identity Priming, about how to change people's attitudes on controversial topics. Harrison and Michelson conducted randomized experiments all over the United States, many in partnership with equality organizations, including Equality Illinois, Georgia Equality, Lambda Legal, Equality Maryland, and Louisiana's Capital City Alliance. They found that people are often willing to change their attitudes about LGBT rights when they find out that others with whom they share an identity (for example, as sports fans or members of a religious group) are also supporters of those rights-particularly when told about support from a leader of the group, and particularly if they find the information somewhat surprising. Fans of the Green Bay Packers football team were influenced by hearing that a Packers Hall-of-Famer is a supporter of LGBT rights. African Americans were influenced by hearing that the Black president of the United States is a supporter. Religious individuals were influenced by hearing that a religious leader is a supporter. And strong partisans were influenced by hearing that a leader of their party is a supporter. Through a series of engaging experiments and compelling evidence, Listen, We Need to Talk provides a blueprint for thinking about how to bring disparate groups together over contentious political issues.},

This revised, updated, and expanded second edition includes two new chapters on the political economy of the Obama era. One presents the Great Recession as a "stress test" of the American political system by analyzing the 2008 election and the impact of Barack Obama's "New New Deal" on the economic fortunes of the rich, middle class, and poor. The other assesses the politics of inequality in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2012 election, and the partisan gridlock of Obama's second term. Larry Bartels offers a sobering account of the barriers to change posed by partisan ideologies and the political power of the wealthy. He also provides new analyses of tax policy, partisan differences in economic performance, the struggle to raise the minimum wage, and inequalities in congressional representation.President Obama identified inequality as "the defining challenge of our time." Unequal Democracy is the definitive account of how and why our political system has failed to rise to that challenge. Now more than ever, this is a book every American needs to read.},

In this paper, we attempt to resolve this debate by examining racial resentment's role in shaping white opinion on a ``racialized'' policy issue that involves no federal action and no government redistribution of resources: ``pay for play'' in college athletics. Using cross-sectional and experimental data from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study and Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we find evidence not only that racial resentment items tap racial predispositions but also that whites rely on these predispositions when forming and expressing their views on paying college athletes. More specifically, we demonstrate that racially resentful whites who were subtly primed to think about African Americans are more likely to express opposition to paying college athletes when compared with similarly resentful whites who were primed to think about whites. Because free-market conservatism, resistance to changes in the status quo, opposition to expanding federal power, and reluctance to endorse government redistributive policies cannot possibly explain these results, we conclude that racial resentment is a valid measure of antiblack prejudice.},

  shorttitle = {Framing Innocence},
  abstract = {Objectives Discourse about criminal justice in the USA increasingly revolves around wrongful convictions. Research has documented the emergence of the ``innocence frame,'' but relatively little is known about its effects on public opinion. We utilize framing theory to examine how various presentations of wrongful conviction information affect attitudes toward the justice system and highlight the consequences of the innocence movement for public opinion.
Methods We implement two survey experiments to test the effects of innocence information for criminal justice attitudes. In the first experiment, we test the impact of wrongful conviction numbers relative to a control group for death penalty support. In the second experiment, we analyze the effects\textemdash{}both separately and jointly\textemdash{}of exoneration numbers and a wrongful conviction narrative relative to a control group for attitudes toward the death penalty and police reform, trust in the justice system, and personal concern.
Results We demonstrate that the presentation of factual numbers of exonerations reduces support for capital punishment and erodes trust in the justice system, but fails to garner support for police reforms or increase personal concern about wrongful convictions. However, a narrative about an individual wrongful conviction predictably has more pronounced effects on death penalty attitudes and increases personal concern and support for police reform, but has little effect on trust in the justice system more broadly.
Conclusions Wrongful convictions are consequential for public opinion, but the effects are contingent on how the information is framed and the attitudinal outcome of interest. Our findings have implications for criminal justice attitudes and policy, the innocence movement, and framing theory.},

We implemented a new approach to cumulative learning, coordinating the design of seven randomized controlled trials to be fielded in six countries by independent research teams. Uncommon for multisite trials in the social sciences, we jointly preregistered a meta-analysis of results in advance of seeing the data. We find no evidence overall that typical, nonpartisan voter information campaigns shape voter behavior, although exploratory and subgroup analyses suggest conditions under which informational campaigns could be more effective. Such null estimated effects are too seldom published, yet they can be critical for scientific progress and cumulative, policy-relevant learning.},

  shorttitle = {Bentham, {{Deleuze}} and {{Beyond}}},
  abstract = {This paper aims to provide an overview of surveillance theories and concepts that can help to understand and debate surveillance in its many forms. As scholars from an increasingly wide range of disciplines are discussing surveillance, this literature review can offer much-needed common ground for the debate. We structure surveillance theory in three roughly chronological/thematic phases. The first two conceptualise surveillance through comprehensive theoretical frameworks which are elaborated in the third phase. The first phase, featuring Bentham and Foucault, offers architectural theories of surveillance, where surveillance is often physical and spatial, involving centralised mechanisms of watching over subjects. Panoptic structures function as architectures of power, not only directly but also through (self-) disciplining of the watched subjects. The second phase offers infrastructural theories of surveillance, where surveillance is networked and relies primarily on digital rather than physical technologies. It involves distributed forms of watching over people, with increasing distance to the watched and often dealing with data doubles rather than physical persons. Deleuze, Haggerty and Ericson, and Zuboff develop different theoretical frameworks than panopticism to conceptualise the power play involved in networked surveillance. The third phase of scholarship refines, combines or extends the main conceptual frameworks developed earlier. Surveillance theory branches out to conceptualise surveillance through concepts such as dataveillance, access control, social sorting, peer-to-peer surveillance and resistance. With the datafication of society, surveillance combines the physical with the digital, government with corporate surveillance and top-down with self-surveillance.},

African Americans who view the system as unfair are much more suspicious of the police in con-frontations with black civilians. Fairness for whites, however, has fewer racial connotations; they naively interpret the confrontations disregarding civilian race. Still, whites holding antiblack stereo-types are much more sympathetic to the police in their confrontations with black civilians. On April 29, 1992, a mainly white jury in Simi Valley, CA voted to acquit four white police officers charged with the beating of Rodney King, an African Amer-ican. Almost immediately, massive rioting erupted in nearby Los Angeles; one of the casualties was Reginald Denny, a white truck driver who was pulled from his vehicle and severely beaten.

  abstract = {When does self-interest influence public opinion on contentious public policies? The bulk of theory in political science suggests that self-interest is only a minor force in public opinion. Using nationally representative survey data, we show how financial and spatial self-interest and partisanship all shape public opinion on opioid treatment policy. We find that a majority of respondents support a redistributive funding model for treatment programs, while treatment funded by taxation based on a community's overdose rate is less popular. Moreover, financial self-interest cross-pressures lower-income Republicans, closing the partisan gap in support by more than half. We also experimentally test how the spatial burden of siting treatment clinics alters policy preferences. People across the political spectrum are less supportive when construction of a clinic is proposed closer to their home. These results highlight how partisanship and self-interest interact in shaping preferences on public policy with concentrated burdens.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses the budgetary responsiveness of American governmental and political institutions to the growth of crime over the last four decades. Several linear decision models are developed which posit that changes in budgetary requests and appropriations for seven criminal justice agencies are functions of changes in the level of criminal activity and of partisan control of the presidency. Tests of these decision models confirm a substantial degree of budgetary responsiveness to growth in the observed crime rate. A significant degree of that responsiveness occurs at the request-formulation stage. While in the short run Congress has actually treated the proposed budgets of the more responsive agencies more severely, it has nonetheless allowed appropriations for criminal justice agencies to grow over the long run in a pattern quite consistent with changes in the crime rate. Virtually all of that responsiveness has occurred, however, under Republican presidents. The statistical performance of the models is quite good--with, typically, over half of the variance accounted for, statistically significant longitudinal regression coefficients, and trivial levels of serial correlation.},

Recently, however, legal professionals and scholars of the courts have begun to question the magnitude of judicial independence, suggesting that budgeting and finance issues pose a threat to judicial independence. This article explores whether state judiciaries are being threatened on this front by soliciting the perceptions of key state officials. Using surveys of court administrators, executive budget officers, and legislative budget officers in the states, we examine three aspects of the politics of judicial budgeting: competing for scarce resources, interbranch competition, and pressure to raise revenues. The survey responses suggest that, in a substantial number of states, judicial independence has, at times, been threatened by interbranch competition and pressures to raise revenues.},

Prior theoretical models, however, suggest the opposite causal path, that is, that moral judgments are driven by political beliefs. In both instances, however, extant research has assumed rather than explicitly tested for causality. So do moral intuitions drive political beliefs or do political beliefs drive moral intuitions? We empirically address this question using data from two panel studies and one nationally representative study, and find consistent evidence supporting the hypothesis that ideology predicts moral intuitions. The findings have significant implications for MFT as a theory of ideology, and also about the consequences of political beliefs for shaping how individuals rationalize what is right and what is wrong.},

New work in political science, however, demonstrates not only that the causal effect of moral foundations on these political predispositions is weaker than once thought, but it also opens the door to the possibility that causality runs in the opposite direction\textemdash{}from political predispositions to moral foundations. In this manuscript, I build on this new work and test the extent to which partisan and ideological considerations cause individuals' moral foundations to shift in predictable ways. The results show that while these group-based cues do exert some influence on moral foundations, the effects of outgroup cues are particularly strong. I conclude that small shifts in political context do cause MFT measures to move, and, to close, I discuss the need for continued theoretical development in MFT as well as an increased attention to measurement.},

Employing a range of measures of important legislative enactments in the postwar period, I find that unified government produces greater quantities of significant enactments and is more responsive to the public mood than is divided government.

We test this theory with data from the American states, which exhibit considerable variation in the sex of state legislative candidates and the high-profile offices of governor and U.S. senator. Using a weighting method and data spanning 1978\textendash{}2012, we demonstrate that high-profile women exert substantively large positive effects on female candidates. We conclude that women in major offices are crucial for women's representation. Beyond their direct policy impact, they amplify women's political voice by motivating more women to enter politics.},

  abstract = {Despite extensive attention to racial disparities in police shootings, two problems have hindered progress on this issue. First, databases of fatal officer-involved shootings (FOIS) lack details about officers, making it difficult to test whether racial disparities vary by officer characteristics. Second, there are conflicting views on which benchmark should be used to determine racial disparities when the outcome is the rate at which members from racial groups are fatally shot. We address these issues by creating a database of FOIS that includes detailed officer information. We test racial disparities using an approach that sidesteps the benchmark debate by directly predicting the race of civilians fatally shot rather than comparing the rate at which racial groups are shot to some benchmark. We report three main findings: 1) As the proportion of Black or Hispanic officers in a FOIS increases, a person shot is more likely to be Black or Hispanic than White, a disparity explained by county demographics; 2) race-specific county-level violent crime strongly predicts the race of the civilian shot; and 3) although we find no overall evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities in fatal shootings, when focusing on different subtypes of shootings (e.g., unarmed shootings or ``suicide by cop''), data are too uncertain to draw firm conclusions. We highlight the need to enforce federal policies that record both officer and civilian information in FOIS.},
